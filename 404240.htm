<h6 id="3">Identification</h6>
<p>Small white Pierid with bright orange or dark brown or black wing tips. All forms of male have black edge of forewing upperside apical tip <i>only reaching one-third of the way from margin to costa</i>. Where this ends, in M<sub>3</sub>, it <i>bends towards apex, forming an elbow penetrating the orange</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sexually dimorphic. Male upperside <i>always has bright orange forewing tip</i>; dark markings range from almost none in extreme dry season forms, to a <i>heavy black 'moustache' mark running along inner margin of forewing and costal margin of hind wing</i>, and a <i>broad black hind wing marginal border</i>. Very many female forms; upperside of many resembles female Bushveld Orange Tip, upperside varying from full 'moustache' to dark wing bases only; forewing apical patch dark markings varying in extent; tip colour varies from bright orange to buff and pale yellow; ground colour from white to pale yellow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Relatively weak, low flight. Both sexes fly at random, often seen on flowers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seasonally polymorphic. There are many forms, particularly of the female, varying according to the seasons. There are many intermediates and the forms shown here only approximate the 'type' for each; the variation is gradual and no two individuals are exactly alike.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All wet season forms' undersides have <i>white to yellow</i> ground colour, more or less extensively marked with black and orange. The male of the extreme wet season form, <i>emini</i>, has the upperside 'moustache' mark extended to reach the outer margin; hind wing dark margin carries <i>no pale blotches</i>. The female is similar but the upperside dark areas are even more extensive, to the point where the white markings may be reduced to reduced to <i>small streaks and blotches</i>. (A) Male upperside. (B) Male underside. (C) Female underside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A commoner wet season form is the less heavily marked f. <i>phlegetonia</i>. The dark markings are similar but the upperside 'moustache' mark <i>does not reach the outer margin</i>; hind wing dark margin <i>has row of submarginal pale blotches</i>. The female sometimes has extensive orange tips. (D) Male upperside. (E) Male underside. (F) Female upperside. (G) Female underside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a transitional form, <i>galathinus</i>. The upperside is similar to the wet
season forms, with the 'moustache' mark <i>faint but visible</i>, with some features of
the dry season forms - the female upperside sometimes has a <i>yellow</i> ground
colour, and has a <i>squared-off hind wing dark postdiscal band</i>, angled outwards at the cell. The underside hind wing of both sexes has a <i>pink to buff ground colour, irrorated with grey scales</i>, which is typical of the dry season forms. (H) Male upperside. (I) Male underside. (J) Female upperside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The normal dry season form is <i>delphine</i>; the male totally lacks a 'moustache' mark and the hind wing upperside margin is <i>white with a row of interneural black spots</i>. The female is one of a range of dry season forms; the upperside has a pale orange forewing tip and carries a faint 'moustache' mark; has a faint dark hind wing dark postdiscal band. The underside hind wing of both sexes has a <i>pink to buff ground colour, irrorated with grey scales</i>. (K) Male upperside. (L) Male underside. (M) Female upperside. (N) Mating pair undersides, female to R.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Female form <i>pseudetrida</i> resembles f. <i>delphine</i> but has orange-yellow cells in the upperside forewing tip; the upperside ground colour is <i>pale yellow</i>. The underside is the same as other dry season forms. (O) Female upperside. (P) Female underside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In female form <i>wa</i> the dark markings are <i>much reduced</i>, with the forewing upperside dark tip carrying a row of <i>pale yellow streaks</i>. Ground colour is <i>cream to pale yellow</i>. The underside is the same as other dry season forms. (Q) Female upperside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In female form <i>xanthotes</i> the dark markings are <i>restricted to the margin</i>, with the forewing upperside tip reduced to a row of <i>pale yellow streaks with a dark basal stripe</i>. Ground colour is <i>pale yellow</i>. The underside is the same as other dry season forms. (R) Female upperside. (S) Female underside.</p>
