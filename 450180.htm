<h6 id="3">Identification</h6>
<p>Small buff butterfly. Pale buff with <i>no</i> markings on either wing surface. Similar wing shape and size to Millar's Buff, <i>Deloneura millari</i>. Nothing else is known about this species.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Three were taken near Fort Bowker in December 1863 by Col. JH Bowker. Two were females and these are usually figured as here; Trimen stated a male to have been taken but its whereabouts are uncertain. The forests near the putative type locality have largely been destroyed so it is unlikely this butterfly will be rediscovered. However, lepidopterists still search, hopefully, for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Habits unrecorded but likely to be similar to other <i>Deloneura</i> Buffs; shy and retiring habits, slow flight with rapid wingbeats, but making little progress. They gather in groups of several specimens, feeding on honeydew secreted by scale insects quite high in the canopy, 3 to 6metres up. The butterflies walk slowly around these insects, their camouflaged undersides making them almost impossible to spot. They hardly ever fly unless deliberately flushed, and the best way to see them is to patiently tap the foliage of suitable trees in the habitat. If a group is disturbed they will fly out, with peculiar fast flapping wingbeats. Although the flight is slow, if chased they can put on a respectable turn of speed.</p>
