<h6 id="3">Identification</h6>
<p>Small brown butterfly with black upperside markings. Large for a <i>Thestor</i>; unique and unmistakable; does not fit into any of the Skolly groups. <i>Brown</i>, as opposed to buff or grey; build <i>more robust</i> than other Skollies and female has distinctive white forewing upperside black and white markings. Underside is pale grey-buff with discal area of forewing whitish, with black basal and postdiscal spots. Hind wing basal and postdiscal series are a darker buff-grey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sexually dimorphic. Males have acutely <i>pointed</i> forewing and <i>straight</i> outer margin. Females have blunt ended forewings and <i>convex</i> outer margin Extent of white on both wings of female is extremely variable. Some specimens are distinctly <i>pied</i>; others have hardly any white and are all dun-brown with heavy black forewing blotches. Nominate subspecies <i>T. b. basuta</i> males have pointed wing tips and the forewing discal area is usually pale grey-brown with darker brown or black marks. The female varies greatly as described, and very dark individuals can be found flying with pale pied examples that would answer to the description of <i>T. b. capeneri</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2 subspp., geographically distinct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Male flies fast, settling often on the ground or on stones. Females are sluggish and usually seen flying slowly, close to the ground, seeking out oviposition spots. Usually seen in small groups of a dozen or so, but occasionally much bigger numbers are seen, huge colonies covering large areas of Grassland.</p>

<h6 id="7">Larval food</h6>
<p>Larvae have been reared to third instar on psyllids (Homoptera), in nests of Pugnacious Ants <i>Anoplolepis custodiens. Thestor b. capeneri</i> larvae feed on <i>Pulvinaria iceryi</i> (Homoptera - Coccidae) until third instar; fourth and final instar larvae live inside nests of Pugnacious Ants, which feed them by trophallaxis; they also consume detritus and ant brood.</p>
