<h6 id="3">Identification</h6>
<p>Medium sized white Pierid with coloured or black forewing tips. Very similar to Coast Purple Tip <i>Colotis erone</i>. Male upperside always white; black forewing apical tip with <i>four</i> not <i>three</i>, discrete metallic purple cells; has dusting of grey scales in black margin. Some specimens have a tiny extra spot of purple on costal edge of tip. Shade of purple <i>shiny and iridescent</i>, but not to the same extent as Queen Purple Tip <i>C. regina</i>. That butterfly has a distinct two&#8211;tone purple&#8211;green 'flop' in the wing tip. Underside varies from pinkish white in all dry season forms <i>but greyer and dingier</i> than Coast Purple Tip; white through cream to yellow in wet season forms; distinctive dark markings remain the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sexually dimorphic; males always have a <i>purple</i> upperside forewing tip; females have several colour morphs &#8211; <i>orange tipped, black tipped and some have brown or cream patches in the black</i>. They generally have <i>five to six spots</i> in the wing tip, compared to <i>three to four</i> in female f. <i>erone</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fast, erratic flight, settling seldom except to feed at flowers. In cloudy weather may stop to bask in sunny patches. Females are less often seen than males because they are more retiring, but also often come to flowers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seasonally polymorphic. Male nominotypical wet season f. <i>ione</i>, found mainly in KwaZulu&#8211;Natal, has extensive black veins on hind wing upperside and on edge of forewing upperside tip, and underside has <i>heavy black veining</i> on white or cream ground colour, with a dark band crossing the hind wing postdiscal area. (A) Male upperside. (B) Male underside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wet season male in the rest of Southern Africa is f. <i>phlegyas</i>, which has <i>reduced</i> black veining in the forewing and <i>faint or absent</i> black underside veining on white or cream ground colour. (C) Male upperside. (D) Male underside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are several wet season female forms. F. <i>ione</i> has <i>orange</i> forewing tips outlined in black, with some red at the basal edge, and <i>heavy black</i> upperside marginal borders, a <i>dark band</i> along the forewing inner margin, dark wing bases, and a dark line crossing the postdiscal area of the hind wing. Underside marked with yellow and buff and has <i>dark marks</i> corresponding to those on upperside. (E) Female upperside. (F) Female underside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Female f. <i>xanthosana</i> resembles f. <i>ione</i> but all white areas are replaced by <i>bright yellow</i>. This form is very rare in South Africa. (G) Female upperside. (H) Female underside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Female f. <i>woodi</i> has the dark upperside marking of f. <i>ione</i> and f. <i>xanthosana</i> but has a <i>black upperside forewing tip</i> containing <i>white spots</i>. (I) Female upperside. (J) Female underside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Female form <i>pepita</i> resembles f. <i>woodi</i> but has the <i>white replaced by yellow</i> as in f. <i>xanthosana</i>. (K) Female upperside. (L) Female underside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dry season male f. <i>jalone</i> has <i>extensive grey scaling</i> in black border to forewing upperside tip: <i>almost no</i> black veins in forewing upperside white area, and <i>reduced</i> hind wing upperside black veins. Underside hind wing ground colour <i>pink, irrorated with darker brown striae</i>, and crossed by a brown postdiscal stripe. (M) Male upperside. (N) Male underside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are several dry season female forms. F. <i>jalone</i> has <i>orange</i> forewing tips edged in brown, with other dark markings <i>restricted or absent</i>. Underside resembles male f. <i>jalone</i>; ground colour <i>pink, irrorated with darker brown striae</i>, basal and discal areas darker brown divided from rest of wing by postdiscal stripe. (O) Female upperside. (P) Female underside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rare female f. <i>leda</i> resembles f. <i>jalone</i> but upperside white is tinged with a greater or lesser degree of <i>primrose yellow</i>. Underside resembles that of f. <i>jalone</i>. (Q) Female upperside. (R) Female underside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Female f. <i>xerophila</i>, also rare, is the dry season counterpart to the wet season f. <i>woodi</i>; forewing tips <i>brown&#8211;black</i> containing small spots. Underside resembles that of f. <i>jalone</i>. (S) Female upperside. (T) Female underside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rare female f. <i>erubescens</i> has the black wing markings of f. <i>xerophila</i> replaced by <i>rich pinkish brown</i>. Underside resembles that of f. <i>jalone</i>. (U) Female upperside. (V) Female underside.</p>
