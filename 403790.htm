<h6 id="3">Identification</h6>
<p>Medium&#8211;small white Pierid with red wing tips and varying degree of black wing markings. Underside varies in ground colour, and amount of <i>prominent black scaling along veins</i>, but both wings usually have a <i>distinct black cell spot</i>. Larger than similar Common Orange Tip <i>Colotis evenina evenina</i>; male upperside wing tips <i>red</i>, not <i>orange</i>; female lacks <i>square, blocky marks</i> on forewing underside. Compared to Smoky Orange Tip <i>C. euippe omphale</i>, it <i>lacks bulge in basal dark edge of orange tip</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sexually dimorphic. Generally, male apical third of forewing upperside <i>vermilion</i>, more or less <i>edged with black</i>, has black marginal hind wing border or spots, <i>black 'moustache'</i> mark formed by black basal edge of forewing and hind wing costal edge. Female forewing upperside apical patch red to orange&#8211;yellow, with black veins, edged with black, black band proximal to patch or crossing it. Variable black basal forewing patch and black marginal borders on both wings, <i>squared&#8211;off hind wing black discal band angled at M<sub>3</sub></i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fast, low flight; wary and easily disturbed; hard to approach closely unless chilled by cool conditions. Male usually follows a 'beat' around a selected patch of bush. Both sexes often seen on flowers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seasonally polymorphic. There are many forms of both sexes, varying according to the seasons. There are many intermediates and the forms shown here only approximate the 'type' for each; the variation is gradual and no two individuals are exactly alike.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Extreme wet season f. <i>gavisa</i> has <i>heavy black markings</i> in both sexes, <i>prominent</i> black underside veining. Female hind wing dark discal band fuses with marginal band. (A) Male upperside. (B) Male underside. (C) Female upperside. (D) Female underside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>F. <i>hero</i> is more common wet season form; male upperside dark markings <i>reduced</i>; underside has <i>reduced underside black veins</i>. Female upperside usually more heavily marked than in f. <i>gavisa</i>. Both sexes with underside variably tinged with yellow. (E) Male upperside. (F) Male underside. (G) Female upperside. (H) Female underside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In drier areas, wet season form <i>helle</i> is found; underside <i>white</i> with <i>no black veins</i>; heavy black upperside markings but the 'moustache' mark is reduced. (I) Male upperside. (J) Male underside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dry season f. <i>zera</i> has reduced upperside black, 'moustache' reduced to basal dark scaling in male, but present in female; female upperside orange tips marked with black but <i>orange more extensive</i>. (K) Male upperside. (L) Male underside. (M) Female upperside. (N) Female underside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Extreme dry season f. <i>harmonides</i> has even less extensive black. Male has <i>no black edges</i> to wing tip, which is usually a <i>washed&#8211;out shade of red</i>. Female has the 'moustache' mark but dark markings appear <i>faded brown</i>; dark marks in forewing tip <i>reduced to a band crossing the tip</i>. Pinkish hind wing underside ground colour, irrorated with reddish brown, in both sexes. (O) Pair in mating display &#8211; female L, male R. (P) Male underside. (Q) Female underside.</p>
