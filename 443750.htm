<h6 id="3">Identification</h6>
<p>Small black-and-orange/red butterflies; uppersides are black with varying degrees of red/orange spots and blotches. Undersides are beautifully camouflaged against their habitat; intricate patterns of black or dark grey on a white or pale grey ground, with submarginal spots in varying shades of red to orange, yellow or white. There are some similar species to Amakosa Rocksitter; Natal Rocksitter <i>Durbania limbata</i> upperside has outer half of hind wing<i>broad</i> red; sexes similar and flies in late summer to autumn, not spring and early summer. And Clark's Rocksitter <i>D. clarki</i> is much smaller and its range does not overlap with that of <i>D. amakosa</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sexually dimorphic. In most subspecies, male has small red-orange to red spots on jet-black ground colour, female with upperside more orange-red. Far southern subspecies <i>D. a. amakosa</i> has narrow, broken buff-orange bands on the upperside. As one goes further north, as in <i>D. a. ayresi</i>, the orange areas are more extensive, in some, almost covering the upperside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7 subspp., geographically distinct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rocksitters, as their name suggests, like to sit on rocks; they do this for long periods with wings closed, their cryptic undersides hiding them well against lichen growing on the rock. Occasionally one will take off and patrol the area searching for mates. The flight is weak and fluttering, and they have trouble with headwinds, so they keep low, in the boundary layer. They lack a proboscis and cannot feed as adults, so they are never seen on flowers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nominate subspecies <i>D. a. amakosa</i> has the dullest red markings and the female has the least extent of red. In some colonies the female has rows of spots like the male; in others the red marks are fused into bands. (A) Male upperside. (B) Female underside. (C), (D) Male undersides.</p>
