<h6 id="3">Identification</h6>
<p>Small white Pierid with bright orange or dark brown or black wing tips. Male upperside resembles small Red Tip <i>Colotis antevippe gavisa</i>; wings <i>more rounded</i>, orange forewing tips <i>duller</i>. Male is easy to distinguish from Small Orange Tip <i>C. evagore antigone</i> by the <i>lack of small black 'elbow'</i> at outer basal edge of tip; basal edge of tip edged with black across wing with no breaks, even in very pale individuals. Forewing of both sexes always has distinct <i>black spot at end of cell</i>. Wet season males have a <i>'moustache'</i> as in Red Tip; in dry season forms, reduced to basal dark patch or absent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sexually dimorphic. Female basic pattern is white ground colour with dark upperside wing tip carrying an orange patch variable from absent to large, and a <i>'moustache'</i> that is heavy in WSFs and weak, but still present, in DSFs. Hind wing has dark marginal and submarginal bands, latter angled outwards at cell. The forewing underside apical patch carries <i>no deep orange areas</i>, but dry season forms may have pale orange suffusion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seasonally polymorphic. There are a large number of named seasonal forms. There are many intermediates and the forms shown here only approximate the 'type' for each; the variation is gradual and no two individuals are exactly alike. Female WSFs have heavy upperside dark markings and pale underside hind wing, DSFs with lighter upperside markings, pink hind wing underside with black scaling, dark postdiscal spots. These can be told apart from the very similar female DSF Small Orange Tip by the <i>lack of underside forewing orange tip</i>, and the patch distal to the hind wing underside cell, which is <i>paler</i> in <i>C. evagore</i>, but <i>same grey&#8211;irrorated pink or buff</i> as rest of hind wing in <i>C. pallene</i>. In many intermediates, forewing upperside apical patch varies from broad orange cells to none at all as in f. <i>absurda.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most heavily marked wet season form is <i>infumatus</i>, with extensive dark markings, a <i>broad</i> hind wing marginal band, and a pale, lightly marked underside. (A) Male upperside. (B) Male underside. Females resemble those of form <i>pallene</i> (F).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The normal summer form in KwaZulu&#8211;Natal is f. <i>seineri</i>, which is more lightly marked with the hind wing marginal band usually broken into triangular spots. (D) Male upperside. Females resemble those of form <i>pallene</i> (F).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Form <i>pallene</i> is the most lightly marked wet season form, which has the black 'moustache' in the male reduced. (D) Male upperside. (E) Male underside. (F) Female upperside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dry season form most often encountered is f. <i>halyattes</i>, whose male has the dark 'moustache' reduced to a basal patch, and has small hind wing marginal dark spots. The female has similar markings to the wet season forms but they are reduced. Dry season form undersides are extensively speckled with dark grey, often with a <i>pink suffusion</i>. (G) Male upperside. (H) Male underside. (I) Female upperside. (J) Female underside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Extreme dry season form <i>pallida</i> male has dark basal marking <i>much reduced or absent</i>; females still have dark markings but these are <i>much reduced</i>. (K) Male upperside. (L) Male and female undersides (in copula). (M) Male underside. (N) Female upperside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some dry season females lack orange in the wing tips and have totally black tips as in females of Small Orange Tip form <i>delphinus</i>. (O) Female upperside. (P) Female underside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, some females &#8211; wet or dry forms &#8211; have the upperside ground colour creamy yellow, not white. This form is not named. (Q) Female upperside.</p>
