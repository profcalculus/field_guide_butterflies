Back to Top
Identification
Very small dark Skipper with black-and-white chequered upperside and forewing underside. One of a group of very similar little butterflies, which are difficult to tell apart from the upperside markings. This species is more distinctive than the others in that none of the upperside markings form bands; they are all discrete spots. Forewing apex markedly pointed, hind wing underside distinctly spotted. Hind wing submarginal spots at M1, and M2 do not form a smooth line with the rest of series, they are placed more basally. Hind wing underside spots mirror those on upperside, large, white, rounded and separated on brown-grey background. Cilia chequered.
 
Sexes similar; females usually larger than males, with larger abdomen.
 
Fast, buzzing, low flight, settling often, wings open. Male patrols territory among thorn trees, often on low, shaded vegetation in flat country or on lower slopes of hills. Female found with males, flying randomly in search of nectar or host plant.

Tiny to small buff butterfly. Female resembles either sex of Lipara Buff Baliochila lipara which is not sexually dimorphic; underside hind wing orange marks prominent, not tiny as in B. lipara. Also resembles Pennington's Buff Cnodontes penningtoni and Pallid Buff C. pallida but underside orange marks are discrete spots and always present in B. aslanga; form indistinct bands and are often absent in Cnodontes spp. Also, both sexes of Cnodontes carry one dark costal mark just outside the forewing cell and do not have dark costal marks at the base of the forewing as in Baliochila spp.
 
Sexually dimorphic. Male has larger dark forewing tip; dark band covering basal half of forewing costa, and large dark blotch distal to end of cell, spreading to CuA1. Female has forewing costal dark spots interspersed with ground colour.
 
Weak, fluttering flight. Usually flies high in canopy, but sometimes found lower down. Settles on twigs, wings closed; periodically suddenly opening them. When doing this it resembles a tiny yellowed leaf waving in the breeze. Occasionally found roosting communally. Female flies lower, searching for oviposition sites. Often found in small groups, imbibing honeydew from scale insects on twigs or leaves.

Large, dark brown Skipper. Distinguished by its white hind wing underside band, which crosses the hind wing with no black spots, and does not taper towards the costa, which it touches. Otherwise it is very similar to Two-pip Policeman Coeliades pisistratus; black-brown upperside with yellow-ochre basal suffusion.
 
Sexes similar; females usually larger and paler than males.
 
Males show very territorial behaviour; they choose a prominent twig or leaf and scent-mark it with a touch of the black-haired anal tuft; behaviour unique in diurnal lepidoptera. On this they perch and make circular sorties around their territory, a 'beat' from which the common name derives. Females are more sedentary and are usually found near the host plants.

Small brightly coloured Skipper. Upperside dark brown with prominent orange-yellow blotches. Cilia plain greyish white. Underside unique among South African Skippers in being completely bright yellow-buff with no dark markings whatever. The only other South African Skipper that resembles it is the rare Marsh Swift Borbo micans, which has a very different upperside as well as being a more orange hue on the underside with yellow streaks along the veins. The only South African Kedestes species with similarly marked uppersides are Macomo Ranger K. macomo, which has several black spots and streaks on the underside, and Pale Ranger K. callicles which has black-ringed white blotches. Upperside resembles that of larger Orange-spotted Hopper Zenonia zeno but the forewing base is not solid orange.
 
Sexes similar, female paler than male, rounder, more elongated wings, abdomen stouter, forewing upperside spots more developed.
 
Males hilltop on koppies and ridges at midday, perching on prominent stones, rocks or vegetation, fast and whirling flight, returning to the same perch. Females more sedentary, seldom seen, usually seeking oviposition sites and feeding on flowers.

Male 70–90 mm female 80–95 mm.
Back to Top
Identification
Large, conspicuous black and yellow butterfly with well-developed spatulate tails. Similar colouring to tailless Citrus Swallowtail Papilio demodocus and much larger Emperor Swallowtail, P. ophidicephalus, but there is never any red colouring on the hind wing anal angle as seen in those species. It is closest in appearance to the Bush Kite P. euphranor, but apart from the difference in habits (it never soars over the canopy as P. euphranor does), it always has a pale spot at the distal end of the forewing cell. The underside is paler than in P. euphranor, with dark 'rays' running between the veins on the postdiscal areas of both wings.
 
Sexes similar; females usually larger and paler than males.
 
Retiring habits, showing a preference for the shade of thick bush, wooded valleys and sand forests. Has the typical swallowtail fluttering, swooping flight, restless, seldom sitting still when nectaring. Like all Swallowtails it often sits on wet mud, drinking - especially males, where animals have urinated on the mud.

Identification
Small butterfly, with dull buff upperside and more rounded wings than the Brauns's Skolly group. The extent and shade of buff colouration varies greatly between yellowish-buff and chocolate brown. Many have dark markings elongated into streaks on forewing. Marginal bands broad, grey-brown. Plainer than Rooiberg Skolly Thestor rooibergensis, colour more uniform, forewing more angulate, but less elongated than Van Son's Skolly, T. vansoni. Hind wing underside is mid-grey with basal and discal rows of dark-edged rings. Both wings have a faint submarginal row of 'V' shaped marks.
 
Sexes similar; females usually paler than males, which have an indistinct grey-brown sex brand at the basal juncture of veins M3 and CuA1.
 
T. montanus lives in colonies, usually along rocky ridges and between large rocks. Flight is low, fast and sustained, dodging between rocks and plants. They settle often on low vegetation or rocks, but are wary and difficult to approach. The females fly more slowly than the males. Usually found in groups of three or four, but in the right conditions can occur in large numbers.

Small bright blue lycaenid (in male). Upperside similar to Fynbos Dotted Blue Tarucus thespis, but is a more violaceous deep sapphire blue. Like that species it has conspicuous black-and-white chequered cilia. Underside ground colour creamy white, regular pattern of black spots with buff to brown centres. Similar to Fynbos Dotted Blue Tarucus thespis but underside hind wing dark marks rounder and more sharply defined; submarginal series sharp and black.
 
T. b. transvaalensis male upperside has dark markings following those on underside; female upperside has greater suffusion with blue than nominate. Sexually dimorphic: male upperside blue. Female upperside pale markings squarer than Dotted Blue T. sybaris, and compared to Fynbos Dotted Blue T. thespis, not confined to forewing apical area, but more generally across all the discal part of the upperside.
 
2 subspp., geographically distinct; a separate population found high on Blouberg Mts, n Limpopo Province, is deeper blue and possibly a distinct subspecies.

Small sapphire. Upperside superficially similar to Red-line Sapphire Iolaus sidus, but dark median line crosses hind wing, and forewing blue less extensive, not as bright. Underside has conspicuous black-edged orange-yellow bands crossing underside of both wings. Very similar on both surfaces to Yellow-banded Sapphire Iolaus aphnaeoides and close to Zimbabwe Yellow-banded Sapphire I. nasisii. The three butterflies have very different ranges. The difference to I. aphnaeoides is the tiny black marginal line at the inner marginal side of the anal angle. In I. diametra natalica it is double. The underside bands are much narrower than those of I. nasisii.
 
Sexes differ; female with wings more rounded, and white edge to forewing upperside blue; area distal to hind wing upperside postdiscal transverse dark stripe white, not blue as in male.
 
Compared to other sapphires, flight slow; may fly close to ground. Flies away rapidly if disturbed, but usually does not go far, and may return. Female closer to host plant. Both sexes are fond of flowers.

Very small, dark Skipper with black-and-white chequered upperside and forewing underside. One of a group of very similar little butterflies, which are difficult to tell apart from the upperside markings. To be reasonably sure of identification a clear view of the hind wing underside is necessary. Separated from other Spialia spp. by hind wing underside median band broken into a series of three spots, character shared with Mountain Sandman Spialia spio. Compared to latter, upperside lacks smaller markings, has no spot at base of forewing costa. Hind wing underside ground colour varies from creamy buff to reddish brown. Cilia chequered.
 
Sexes similar; females usually larger than males, with larger abdomen.
 
Fast, buzzing, low flight, settling often, wings open. Always found in grassy areas, even in middle of Fynbos or Karoo, usually on slopes of koppies and sand dunes.

Identification
Medium sized black butterfly with white bands crossing the wings near their edges. One of two species of Piper found in South Africa. White bar on black ground conspicuous; rare form vashti, seen occasionally in coastal forests, has dull orange-ochre wing bands on upperside. Distinguished from Golden Piper Eurytela dryope angulata which has orange bands that spread as far as the outer margin.
 
Sexes similar.
 
It has a slow, floating, gliding flight, wings held open with sporadic rapid wingbeats. Males form territories, usually on a prominent bush on the forest edge, and pursue other butterflies that approach. Wary and difficult to approach, if disturbed it flies off between the branches and is hard to follow. Both sexes are attracted to fallen, rotting fruit, and come readily to fruit bait.

Small buff butterfly. Deep buff with brown-black wing tip margins and grey-mottled hind wing underside. Compared to Zulu Buff it has an orange shade of buff as opposed to bright yellow-buff, and the wings have no spots, which also separates it from Spotted Buff, Pentila tropicalis. Compared to Lipara Buff Baliochila lipara, Common Buff B. aslanga, Pallid Buff C. pallida and Pennington's Buff Cnodontes penningtoni it is larger and has no basal or discal upperside forewing marks, except for a dark brown to black wingtip which narrows into a costal band, which extends without break, fading to the ground colour as it reaches the base.
 
Sexes similar; male has small raised bar of scent scales at base of forewing upperside.
 
Shy and retiring habits, slow flight with rapid wingbeats, but making little progress. They gather in groups of several specimens, feeding on honeydew secreted by scale insects quite high in the canopy, 3 to 6 metres up. The butterflies walk slowly around these insects, their camouflaged undersides making them almost impossible to spot. They hardly ever fly unless deliberately flushed, and the best way to see them is to patiently tap the foliage of suitable trees in the habitat. If a group is disturbed they will fly out, with peculiar fast flapping wingbeats. Although the flight is slow, if chased they can put on a respectable turn of speed.

Medium sized brown butterfly with paler bands and blotches. Most familiar and widespread Precis species in South Africa. It has two seasonal forms, which are different in appearance and habits. Both forms have a brown upperside ground colour with a broad postdiscal band and basal blotches of paler colouring. Wet season (summer) form postdiscal band is bright cream to orange-buff. Could be confused with Dry-leaf Commodore Precis tugela or Soldier Pansy Junonia terea elgiva but underside similar to upperside; does not have dead leaf appearance. Dry season (winter) form upperside postdiscal bands are maroon -red; marginal, apical and cell spots pale blue to white. Underside resembles a dead, dry leaf in shades of dark green, olive and pinkish white to buff. Intermediates quite common; usually in the form of dry season form with postdiscal band of deep buff.
 
Sexes similar, female with wings rounder.
 
Flies at low height to a metre or two above the ground. Short glides interspersed with bursts of rapid wingbeats. Flies away rapidly if disturbed; males strongly territorial, sitting on prominent point, chasing away intruders. and if chased away, usually returning to where first seen. Summer form is a very active butterfly, usually found on open hillsides and summits. Winter form is more skulking, found more often gardens and woods near montane Grassland, or along stream banks. It hibernates in deep gullies and under banks and rocks.
 
Dry season form f. archesia upperside is brown, maroon and blue. Wet season form f. pelasgis brown, with cream to buff postdiscal bands.

Back to Top
Identification
Large, dark Charaxes. In certain parts of its range, males can be confused with Blue-Spotted Charaxes, Charaxes cithaeron cithaeron. However, that species has much broader hind wing upperside pale patch, almost totally white. The postdiscal series of forewing royal blue marks are smaller in male C. xiphares. Females are distinctive. Nominate C. x. xiphares has the female inner tail curved strongly inwards than in other subspp.
 
Sexes strongly dimorphic, male with royal blue spots and bands on metallic navy ground, female with white discal forewing band (of variable width) sometimes invaded by yellow-ochre. Most females have a pale yellow hind wing upperside patch, but in some populations, it is blue-white or pale mauve. Differences between females is usually of more value than subtle differences between the males in distinguishing subspecies.
 
Powerful, high flight in the canopy and around tree tops. Males territorial, perching high up and pursuing any butterfly (or other flying creature) that ventures nearby. Females fly rapidly along the fringes of forests where they settle on tree leaves.
 
Both sexes are attracted to rotting fruit, animal dung and sap leaking from wounded trees.

One of South Africa's most striking small Blues. One of several small lycaenids with stark white undersides dotted with black. Distinguished from White Tuxentius calice calice and Black T. melaena Pies by presence of blue on upperside and on the underside by the row of three black apical spots separate where the Pies have a bar. Distinguished from Dotted Blue Tarucus sybaris by less even pattern of black dots on the underside, and the submarginal row of short bars where Dotted Blue has only dots.
 
Sexes differ. Male has glittering, semi-transparent blue. Female is a white butterfly with black dots following those on the underside; bases of wings carry a varying amount of blue.
 
Rapid, fluttering flight, not far off the ground. Difficult to separate on the wing from Tuxentius or Tarucus spp. Some specimens have been photographed from the N Cape that have the underside black spots reduced as in the Namibian subspecies Z. hintza krooni, but the male upperside has not been recorded. In that subspecies the male upperside has conspicuous white spots.

Medium to large (for a lycaenid), showy sapphire with distinctive pattern of black-and-white postdiscal blotches and basal violaceous blue on the forewing, and streaked pattern of white, violaceous blue and grey-black on the hind wing. The only similar species in South Africa is Dusky Sapphire, S. subinfuscata reynoldsi, but the upperside violaceous blue colouring tends to be lighter. The major difference is on the underside, where the marginal bands and the area basal to the hind wing dark median band are pale grey or white, not dark grey.
 
The sexes are very similar; females tend to have more extensive white in the apical area of the forewing upperside. S. b. tearei is on average the largest and most widespread subspecies. The white upperside markings are larger and more extensive, and the white areas on the underside less suffused with dull grey.
 
3 subspp., geographically distinct. Flight fast, but slower than other sapphires. Males perch alert on or in prominent bushes on low rocky ridges, chasing intruders; female more sedentary, more usually found near host plants.

Wingspan
Male 26–35 mm female 29–38 mm.
Back to Top
Identification
Small black-and-orange/red butterflies; uppersides are black with varying degrees of red/orange spots and blotches. Undersides are beautifully camouflaged against their habitat; intricate patterns of black or dark grey on a white or pale grey ground, with submarginal spots in varying shades of red to orange, yellow or white. There are some similar species to Amakosa Rocksitter; Natal Rocksitter Durbania limbata upperside has outer half of hind wing broad red; sexes similar and flies in late summer to autumn, not spring and early summer. And Clark's Rocksitter D. clarki is much smaller and its range does not overlap with that of D. amakosa.
 
Sexually dimorphic. D. a. penningtoni has the palest upperside spots and bands of all the subspecies. It varies from yellow-buff in most males, to almost yellow in the large females, which when they have the broadest bands, can be mistaken for Yellow Pansy Junonia hierta cebrene on the wing.
 
7 subspp., geographically distinct.
 
Rocksitters, as their name suggests, like to sit on rocks; they do this for long periods with wings closed, their cryptic undersides hiding them well against lichen growing on the rock. Occasionally one will take off and patrol the area searching for mates. The flight is weak and fluttering, and they have trouble with headwinds, so they keep low, in the boundary layer. They lack a proboscis and cannot feed as adults, so they are never seen on flowers.

Identification
One of a large group of Chrysoritis Opals with blue wing bases and a shimmering, electric opalescent sheen over a varying area of the wings. For Chrysoritis thysbe, amount of blue on upperside varies, in some subspecies almost covering the forewing. Forewing underside has typical 'Copper' pattern of black spots on a pale ground with dark borders. Hind wing underside varies from plain sandy tan to dark brown, to variegated with striae in various shades of reddish-brown, with bands of paler colouring and brassy postdiscal streaks. 'Plain' underside specimens usually have unicoloured cilia; 'variegated' ones dark cilia with pale interneural flecks, appearing 'chequered'.
 
C. t. osbecki usually has unicoloured cilia and plain underside; may be found flying together with nominate. Sexes differ. Female has rounder wings, upperside blue restricted to basal 25% of wings, no opalescent sheen. The females of the various races are almost impossible to separate on wing patterns and identification usually requires comparison with males seen at the same locality.
 
7 subspp., not always geographically distinct. Rapid, sustained flight, settling on prominent bushes or rocks. Male intensively territorial on hill tops or sand dunes, regularly patrolling and chasing intruders; Females are found more at random, often on flowers.

Identification
Medium to large butterfly, with weak but sustained fluttering flight, sometimes sailing, at medium height, 2–3m above the ground. Usually found flying alone or in small groups, but may be found in large numbers on wounded plants exuding pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Fond of nectar. This species has complex biogeography; it is widespread across Asia, southern Europe and the whole of Africa. Several subspecies occur across this range, the relationship between these is the subject of several studies.
 
Sexes similar; males have large dark spot in area CuA2 of hind wing; black on upperside, white-centred on underside.
 
Danaus chrysippus alcippus is the common subspecies in Central and West Africa, and varies as to the extent and depth of the chocolate-brown basal suffusion.
 
It is possible that the appearance of forms resembling D. c. alcippus among the South African D. c. orientis population is a result of edge-of-range interbreeding with those races when climatic conditions make this possible.

Identification
Medium sized white Pierid with coloured or black forewing tips. Very similar to Bushveld Purple Tip Colotis ione. Male upperside always white; black forewing apical tip with three discrete metallic purple cells and no grey scaling in the black border. Some specimens have a tiny extra spot of purple on costal edge of tip, never four full-sized spots as in Bushveld Purple Tip. Also, purple less obviously shiny and iridescent. Queen Purple Tip C. regina has a distinct two-tone purple-green 'flop' in the wing tip, and is larger. Underside varies from pinkish white in all dry season forms, to deep yellow in wet season forms; distinctive dark markings remain the same.
 
Sexually dimorphic; males always have a purple upperside forewing tip; females
have two colour morphs - orange-tipped and black-tipped.
Orange-tipped forms have four dark spots in the orange, compared to
five in female f. ione orange-tipped forms. Black-tipped forms three pale spots compared with four to five in dark-tipped forms of female Bushveld Purple Tip.
 
Fast, erratic flight, jinking in various directions but maintaining a steady course. Settles seldom except to feed at flowers. In cloudy weather may stop to bask in sunny patches. Females are less often seen than males because they are more retiring, but also often come to flowers.
 
Seasonally polymorphic. Male wet season form erone has black veins on hind wing upperside and on edge of forewing tip. (A) Male upperside. (B) Male underside.

Separated from similar False Silver-bottom Brown by P. magoides having
anally more pointed hind wing with three submarginal ocelli. The ocelli are never
'blind'. Underside hind wing ground colour also silvery grey, but more or less
covered with brownish markings. Colouration variable, from pure silver grey with
plain dark marginal border, to having varying amounts of red-brown striation.
Hind wing underside discal band red-brown, prominent to indistinct. Specimens
from lower altitude populations in KwaZulu-Natal tend to have more rounded wings and darker brown underside markings than high altitude specimens from Lesotho and the E Cape. This butterfly is the subject of biogeographical studies and may comprise more than one species or subspecies. The God's Window population is possibly one of these. More information on northern populations is desirable.
 
Similar Swanepoel's Brown P. swanepoeli has fewer ocelli and differences in the marginal dark lines on hind wing underside.

Small, brilliant scarlet-red lycaenid. Male Black-tipped Scarlet similar to Common Scarlet Axiocerses tjoane tjoane and Dark-banded Scarlet A. croesus but has totally black forewing tip with no discal black spots. Bush Scarlet A. amanga amanga has a plain hind wing underside with no brassy spots.
 
The underside ground colour varies from pale sandy buff to a deep reddish brown. The forewing has a similar spotting pattern to most Coppers; the hind wing has rows of dark spots with brassy centres.
 
Sexes differ; females are more orange than red on the upperside with a varying extent of rows of dark spotting: they are virtually impossible to distinguish from the other two similar species.
 
Males are extremely pugnacious hilltoppers. Rapid flight with very fast wingbeats, especially in males. Male perches at midday on low bushes, often upside down, with half-open wings. Females are more often found on flowers and close to host plants.

Small, bright orange Charaxes. Superficially similar to Club-tailed Charaxes Charaxes zoolina f. neanthes, but with black spots, not red-brown, and has two tails in both sexes. Tails are sharply pointed, not clubbed. C. j. rex is the largest local subspecies. It has less well-developed upperside dark markings. Hind wing underside basal area is darker than C. j. jahlusa and more orange than C. j. argynnides.
 
Sexes similar, but male has narrower, more triangular wings.
 
Although this is a small Charaxes it lacks nothing in speed of flight or, in the male, pugnacity. Males form territories on hilltops, or in flat country, around prominent bushes and trees. They pursue any butterfly (or other flying creature) that ventures nearby. Females are found close to the host plants, or wandering around searching for males.
 
Both sexes are attracted to rotting fruit, animal dung and sap leaking from wounded trees.

Sexually dimorphic, male with brilliant white upperside, dark forewing marginal border broken into spots at vein ends; black spots at hind wing vein ends. Underside hind wing white with yellow costal edge. There are two female forms. More common female f. gertrudae has forewing tips diffuse black, veins black at wing edges, forewing basal patch orange, variable extent of hind wing yellow; underside similar to upperside. Rarer f. phoebe has both surfaces of hind wing deep yellow, upperside with heavy marginal sagittate black marks along veins, forewing upperside tip black with yellow streaks between veins. These features tell it apart from Trimen's Dotted Border, Mylothris trimenia, which has no dark marks along veins.

Submarginal row of 'V' shaped marks reduced, as in T. montanus.
 
Sexually dimorphic. Female sometimes much larger than male but both sexes variable in size. Male forewing has grey-brown sex brand in basal part of CuA1 and CuA2, spreading along veins M3, CuA1 and CuA2.
 
T. strutti lives in colonies, usually on high, (usually) north-facing mountain slopes, between large rocks and in shallow gullies. The females fly more slowly than the males. Flight is low, fast and sustained, dodging between rocks. They settle often on low vegetation or rocks, but are wary and difficult to approach. Usually found in groups of three or four, but in the right conditions can occur in large numbers.

Identification
Small bright yellow Pierid. Differs from African Clouded Yellow Colias electo electo in upperside ground colour yellow, not orange, and Spiller's Sulphur Yellow Dixeia spilleri, in that it has broad black borders. Black forewing upperside marginal band scalloped, which sets it apart from other Eurema species except Common Grass Yellow E. hecabe. This is a very similar species but Malagasy Grass Yellow can be told from it as follows: underside hind wing cell spot strongly widens towards the apical end, to more than twice the width of the narrow portion. The hind wing margin is continuously black, or if it is reduced as in dry season individuals, the marks at the end of the veins are discrete spots, not linear smudges. Best identifying feature is where the scalloped edge of forewing upperside black border bends inwards halfway up area M2, not along vein M3 as in Common Grass Yellow (see arrow in (A)).
 
Sexes similar, female paler yellow than male, has grey scaling at upperside wing bases.
 
Flies rapidly along thick forest vegetation, settling occasionally on flowers or vegetation.
 
Seasonally dimorphic.
 
Dry season form has dark smudges at the hind wing upperside margin vein ends; underside forewing tip carries a square dark patch: (A) Female upperside. (B) Male underside.

Medium sized butterfly. Battling Glider is the smaller of South Africa's two Cymothoe species; the other being Blonde Glider Cymothoecoranus coranus. Compared to that species, apart from size, C. alcimeda has more angulate wings and, usually, a more heavily marked underside. Nominate subspecies C. a. alcimeda male upperside is distinctive with big dark mark at end of forewing cell. Sexually dimorphic: there is only one female form of the nominate subspecies, but there is more than one subspecies and those females are polymorphic. Male upperside creamy white; both sexes' underside cryptic.
 
Both sexes have the typical Liminitinae gliding flight with bursts of rapid wingbeats. Males perch high up on forest edge trees and shrubs, and sally forth to chase away all other insects. When there is more than one male in a forest clearing, constant aerial battles take place, hence the common name. Females are found close to the host plants. Both sexes regularly drink at wet mud, and nectar from flowers. They are also attracted to fruit bait.

Of the Bars, genus Cigaritis this is on average the largest, and the most
widespread. Like Mozambique Bar Cigaritis mozambica the underside dark bars are
straight, which sets them apart from the other three species found in South Africa.
Compared to that species the underside ground colour is paler and the bars
brown, not orange. Each hind wing carries a pair of thin tails with white tips at
the anal angle. There are two forms; the nominate, with prominent orange and black
forewing upperside bars, is commoner. f. obscurus, which has the orange more or
less obscured by dark grey or black, is usually found in KwaZulu-Natal and the lowveld, in the dry season.
 
Sexes similar. Females are larger with more rounded wings. The upperside usually has pale whitish patches in the forewing discal area, and hind wing apical area.
 
Rapid flight with very fast wingbeats, especially in males. Male perches at midday on prominent hill top bushes, often upside down, with half-open wings. Both sexes are found on flowers and at mud puddles.

Male 26–32 mm female 29–41 mm.
Back to Top
Identification
Medium to large (for a lycaenid), showy sapphire with distinctive pattern of black-and-white postdiscal blotches and basal violaceous blue on the forewing, and streaked pattern of white, violaceous blue and grey-black on the hind wing. The only similar species in South Africa is Dusky Sapphire, S. subinfuscata reynoldsi, but the upperside violaceous blue colouring tends to be lighter. The major difference is on the underside, where the marginal bands and the area basal to the hind wing dark median band are pale grey or white, not dark grey.
 
The sexes are very similar; females tend to have more extensive white in the apical area of the forewing upperside. Nominate subspecies S. b. bowkeri is variable in the extent of the white upperside areas, and the width and shade of the dark brown lines crossing the underside. The white upperside forewing marks tend to be elongated and 'streaky' in appearance compared to the other subspecies, and the underside more or less suffused with dull grey.
 
3 subspp., geographically distinct. Flight fast, but slower than other sapphires. Males perch alert on or in prominent bushes on low rocky ridges, chasing intruders; female more sedentary, more usually found near host plants. Both sexes attracted to flowers, such as Puzzlebush Ehretia rigida, sometimes in numbers.

Slightly smaller than the other two Capys found in South Africa. Most widespread Protea butterfly in South Africa; the only one to show dimorphism in sexes. This distinguishes it from the rare Pennington's Protea, C. penningtoni, whose underside is very similar and males can be difficult to tell apart from photographs.
 
Sexes differ. In general, Russet Protea males are a redder, brighter shade of bronze on the upperside, and the dark margins are more sharply defined, but this is not always the case, especially in worn individuals. Female upperside varies from brown to dove-grey with russet edges, sometimes a buff forewing apical streak.
 
Males frequent hilltops, They perch on the ground, on rocks or on vegetation; sometimes on prominent specimens of the host plant. The females are found lower down, on flowers sometimes but usually around the host plant.

Male 26–30 mm female 29–35 mm.
Back to Top
Identification
Small black-and-orange/red butterflies; uppersides are black with varying degrees of red/orange spots and blotches. Undersides are beautifully camouflaged against their habitat; intricate patterns of black or dark grey on a white or pale grey ground, with submarginal spots in varying shades of red to orange, yellow or white. There are some similar species to Amakosa Rocksitter; Natal Rocksitter Durbania limbata upperside has outer half of hind wing broad red; sexes similar and flies in late summer to autumn, not spring and early summer. And Clark's Rocksitter D. clarki is much smaller and its range does not overlap with that of D. amakosa.
 
Sexually dimorphic. In most subspecies, male has small red-orange to red spots on jet-black ground colour, female with upperside more orange-red. Far southern subspecies D. a. amakosa has narrow, broken buff-orange bands on the upperside. As one goes further north, as in D. a. ayresi, the orange areas are more extensive, in some, almost covering the upperside.
 
7 subspp., geographically distinct.
 
Rocksitters, as their name suggests, like to sit on rocks; they do this for long periods with wings closed, their cryptic undersides hiding them well against lichen growing on the rock. Occasionally one will take off and patrol the area searching for mates. The flight is weak and fluttering, and they have trouble with headwinds, so they keep low, in the boundary layer. They lack a proboscis and cannot feed as adults, so they are never seen on flowers.
 
Nominate subspecies D. a. amakosa has the dullest red markings and the female has the least extent of red. In some colonies the female has rows of spots like the male; in others the red marks are fused into bands. (A) Male upperside. (B) Female underside. (C), (D) Male undersides.

Fluttering flight, fairly low. Inhabits more heavily wooded country than other Eurema spp. Settles often on flowers or vegetation.
 
Seasonally dimorphic; wet season form pseudoregularis has broader black wing margins on upperside than dry season form marshalli; latter has hind wing margin broken into a series of black spots. In extreme dry season individuals, there is only a tiny edge of black at apical margin of forewing on upperside. Undersides of the seasonal forms very similar; dry season individuals tend to have paler, redder dark markings.

Identification
Large white or yellow-buff Pierid with dark margins. Often mistaken for very similar Common Dotted Border Mylothris agathina in both sexes, but the distinguishing factor is the row of black hind wing marginal dots. In Common Dotted Border these are confined to the margin. In Belenois thysa thysa there is an extra row of submarginal black dots. There are other differences; the flight pattern is more robust and some female forms of False Dotted Border have extensive dark basal patches, which is never the case with the Common Dotted Border. The hind wing underside is always bright canary yellow.
 
Sexually dimorphic; males are always white on the upperside with dark marginal and submarginal marks varying in extent according to seasonal form. Females' upperside patterns also vary according to seasonal form, and have varying amounts of colour and dark shading.
 
Male flies fast, high along forest edges, occasionally settles on flowers; female slower, settles more often.
 
Seasonally polymorphic. Wet season form is thysa; male upperside has large, extensive dark marginal markings; submarginal series always visible on hind wing upperside. Female variable; always has pale orange blush at forewing upperside base. Some specimens have extensive basal and discal dark grey-black patches. (A) Male upperside. (B) Male underside.

Back to Top
Identification
One of a large group of Chrysoritis Opals with blue wing bases and a shimmering, electric opalescent sheen over a varying area of the wings. For Chrysoritis thysbe, amount of blue on upperside varies, in some subspecies almost covering the forewing. Forewing underside has typical 'Copper' pattern of black spots on a pale ground with dark borders. Hind wing underside varies from plain sandy tan to dark brown, to variegated with striae in various shades of reddish-brown, with bands of paler colouring and brassy postdiscal streaks. 'Plain' underside specimens usually have unicoloured cilia; 'variegated' ones dark cilia with pale interneural flecks, appearing 'chequered'.
 
C. t. schloszae in the male, solid blue covers forewing cell spot and usually extends slightly beyond. Outer margin usually has narrow orange border; may be limited to the cilia, which are only weakly chequered. Hind wing underside is consistently light brown variegated with striae and silvery white streaks. Sexes differ. Female has rounder wings, upperside blue restricted to basal 25% of wings, no opalescent sheen. The females of the various races are almost impossible to separate on wing patterns and identification usually requires comparison with males seen at the same locality.
 
7 subspp., not always geographically distinct. Rapid, sustained flight, settling on prominent bushes or rocks. Male intensively territorial on hill tops or sand dunes, regularly patrolling and chasing intruders; Females are found more at random, often on flowers.

With Dira swanepoeli, one of the two largest Dira species. The most widespread of the two, found over a large area of the E Cape and into s KwaZulu-Natal. Smaller individuals are the same size as large specimens of Dira clytus eurina. but having three or four ocelli in the forewing apex, not two. Dira oxylus is also more localised in its habits and is found in discrete colonies.
 
A large colony of Dira oxylus flying in the cool of the morning is an unforgettable sight. The sailing, floating fight of the males close to the tall grasses is sustained and graceful. Later, in the heat of the day, they shelter in the shade of large rocks and trees. Females are far less active and stay low.
 
The sexes are similar but the male has a distinctive bronze-green sheen. Females have larger, brighter hind wing upperside ocelli than the male.

Identification
Smallest and most abundant South African Tree Nymph. Compared to Sevenia natalensis and Sevenia morantii, underside is more heavily mottled with pale grey and buff, submarginal row of prominent black spots always present.
 
Sexually dimorphic. Male upperside flat brown, with reddish-ringed black submarginal spots on hind wing. Female has apical black patch with orange blotches. Prominent submarginal row of black spots on both sexes' uppersides.
 
Fond of sitting on tree bark, also roosts under leaves. Flipping, short flight from tree trunk to tree trunk. Very wary and hard to approach closely. Sometimes in swarms of many thousands in late summer. The gregarious larvae may totally defoliate even large specimens of the host plant, and when the adults emerge they give the impression that the tree has brown leaves. Drinks from wet mud. Strongly attracted to fermenting fruit and sap leaking from wounded trees; may totally fill baited traps.

Small bright orange Skipper. Upperside dark brown with prominent orange bands; the entire discal area of the forewing is orange, totally enclosing an 'Arrowhead' shaped mark in the cell and the area distal to it. Cilia plain yellowish white. Underside orange-yellow; forewing has black spot at end of cell, and dark blotch near the tornus that extends to the inner margin in the darker forms. Hind wing has distinct pale buff streaks edged with dark brown on an orange ground. This is unique in Skippers found in South Africa. Upperside similar to Axehead Orange Acada biseriata but the forewing upperside costal orange streak joins the apical orange patch to form a continuous band around the dark 'Arrowhead' mark in the cell. Also similar to Morant's Orange Parosmodes morantii, but forewing upperside orange cell spot is merged with postdiscal orange band. Upperside also resembles that of larger Orange-spotted Hopper Zenonia zeno but the forewing base is not solid orange and the orange discal band is not fused.
 
Further north there are three forms - nominate, form ruso and form merops. The specimens found to date in South Africa appear to be form ruso, which is paler than the nominate, which has wider upperside dark margins and 'arrowhead' markings. Form merops has more extensive upperside orange, with narrower upperside dark margins and very slender 'arrowhead' markings.

However, the green eyes are not seen in African Migrant, and the dark wing tips of N. buquetii are much broader.
 
Sexes similar, female upperside forewing tips paler than male.
 
Rapid, sustained flight, stopping seldom, unless at flowers (usually orange or red, but they are fond of Plumbago) to nectar. Any bright red object will attract them.
 
Nominate dry season form buquetii has wide dark upperside forewing tips: (A) Female upperside. (B) Male underside.
 
Dry season, southern f. capensis (predominates from KwaZulu-Natal southwards), dark tips absent or reduced to a thin black line around the margin of the apex: (C) Male upperside.

Identification
Small black-and-orange/red butterflies; uppersides are black with varying degrees of red/orange spots and blotches. Undersides are beautifully camouflaged against their habitat; intricate patterns of black or dark grey on a white or pale grey ground, with submarginal spots in varying shades of red to orange, yellow or white. There are some similar species to Amakosa Rocksitter; Natal Rocksitter Durbania limbata upperside has outer half of hind wing broad red; sexes similar and flies in late summer to autumn, not spring and early summer. And Clark's Rocksitter D. clarki is much smaller and its range does not overlap with that of D. amakosa.
 
Sexually dimorphic. D. a. albescens has extensive white irroration on the forewing upperside apex, and the hind wing underside has no coloured spots, only white where other subspecies have red, yellow or orange. Females have narrow pale orange upperside bands.
 
7 subspp., geographically distinct.
 
Rocksitters, as their name suggests, like to sit on rocks; they do this for long periods with wings closed, their cryptic undersides hiding them well against lichen growing on the rock. Occasionally one will take off and patrol the area searching for mates. The flight is weak and fluttering, and they have trouble with headwinds, so they keep low, in the boundary layer. They lack a proboscis and cannot feed as adults, so they are never seen on flowers.

Back to Top
Identification
Large, dark Charaxes. In certain parts of its range, males can be confused with Blue-Spotted Charaxes, Charaxes cithaeron cithaeron. However, that species has much broader hind wing upperside pale patch, almost totally white. The postdiscal series of forewing royal blue marks are smaller in C. xiphares. Females are distinctive. C. x. penningtoni male is distinguished by blue spot in area M3, which is longer than either neighbouring race C. x. draconis or C. x. thyestes. The female has particularly large, clear white forewing discal spots. The normal female form has a yellow hind wing upperside discal patch; in rare f. luminosa it is lavender-blue.
 
Sexes strongly dimorphic, male with royal blue spots and bands on metallic navy ground, female with white discal forewing band (of variable width) sometimes invaded by yellow-ochre. Most females have a pale yellow hind wing upperside patch, but in some populations, it is blue-white or pale mauve. Differences between females is usually of more value than subtle differences between the males in distinguishing subspecies.
 
Powerful, high flight in the canopy and around tree tops. Males territorial, perching high up and pursuing any butterfly (or other flying creature) that ventures nearby. Females fly rapidly along the fringes of forests where they settle on tree leaves. In C. x. penningtoni, the females are much commoner than males, possibly due to a male-killing pathogen. In its haunts the females adopt the same tree-topping habits as males.
 
Both sexes are attracted to rotting fruit, animal dung and sap leaking from wounded trees.

Medium–small white Pierid with orange wing tips and varying degree of black wing
markings. Difference to Smoky Orange Tip Colotis euippe omphale is lack of bulge
in basal dark edge of orange tip; paler orange wing tip colour. Neither species has a
white-edged dark diagonal stripe running from base to middle of the hind wing underside margin at M3. Differs from Red Tip C. antevippe gavisa in the distinct orange colour of the forewing tips, and both sexes lacking black spot at end of cell on upperside of forewing.
 
Sexually dimorphic. Male upperside resembles small Red Tip Colotis antevippe gavisa; has paler, pure orange forewing tips; female with distal edge of forewing basal patch on both surfaces forming three square blocks. Female orange forewing tip crossed by dark stripe.
 
Fast, low flight. Both sexes fly at random, often seen on flowers.
 
Seasonally polymorphic. There are many forms of both sexes, varying according to the seasons. There are many intermediates and the forms shown here only approximate the 'type' for each; the variation is gradual and no two individuals are exactly alike.
 
Wet season male nominate f. evenina is similarly marked to Red Tip, except for orange colour of forewing tip. Underside hind wing white to yellow, faint diagonal stripe and orange patches in extreme wet season form; veining never dark. Female often heavily marked in black, to the point where she is a black butterfly with white bands and a orange tip largely obscured by black. More lightly marked specimens have less black in the orange tip but still have heavy black stripes across the white areas. Underside may have extensive orange bands corresponding to upperside black bands. (A) Male upperside. (B) Male underside.(C) Female upperside. (D) Female underside.

Identification
Very small butterfly with patterns of orange or orange-red and black on the upperside; has a greater or lesser amount of black in the centre of the forewing depending on sex and subspecies. Underside irrorated with black, grey and white with tiny submarginal spots on the hind wing. The other Rocksitters that fly in the same areas are Boland Rocksitter Durbaniopsis saga and two of the races of Amakosa Rocksitter, Durbania amakosa amakosa and D. a. penningtoni. Durbaniella clarki is generally smaller than either, although small males of D. saga can be in the same size range. It can immediately be distinguished from that species by the underside; D. clarki lacks the conspicuous dark and light bands of D. saga. Compared to D. amakosa, the differences are sex-related. Females of D. amakosa are always much larger and have more extensive, better defined patterns of orange or orange-red and black on the upperside. D. a. amakosa males have discrete orange-red spots on the upperside. D. a. penningtoni males have very similar upperside markings to D. clarki but they are more of a yellow-buff colour and the hind wing base is dark, .
 
Variable degree of sexual dimorphism depending on subspecies.
 
D. c. phaea is a dark subspecies; upperside apical pale spots reduced or absent; male forewing postdiscal band broken into spots. Upperside colouration varies from dull orange-buff to brick red; discal black patch extensive in both sexes.
 
4 subspp., geographically distinct; varying in markings and colour.
 
Rocksitters, as their name suggests, like to sit on rocks; they do this for long periods with wings closed, their cryptic undersides hiding them well against lichen growing on the rock.

Back to Top
Identification
Medium sized brown butterfly with orange bands. It has two seasonal forms, which are different in wing shape. Both forms have a brown upperside ground colour with a broad orange median to postdiscal band. Wet season (summer) form lacks the long, hooked forewing apex of the dry season (winter) form, and has shorter hind wing tails. In its habitat the only butterfly likely to be confused with it is Soldier Pansy Junonia terea elgiva, but that is generally smaller and the orange bands lack the small interneural spots that are always present in P. tugela. One of the finest dead-leaf mimics; no two undersides are ever exactly alike.
 
Sexes similar, female larger with broader wings and less dramatically hooked wing tips.
 
Wet season form f. aurorina smaller than nominate dry season form f. tugela, with both sexes' wing tips less prominently hooked.
 
Flies along lanes and edges of clearings in deep forest. Short glides interspersed with bursts of rapid wingbeats. Flies away rapidly if disturbed; males strongly territorial, sitting on prominent point, chasing away intruders. and if chased away, usually returning to where first seen. Very wary; heads for the canopy when disturbed.

One of the larger sapphires; upperside intense metallic blue with broad black margins and shiny white underside, and conspicuous red lunules at the hind wing anal angle. Underside hind wing crossed by submarginal thin red line that is usually, but not always, curved toward the body. In Straight-line Sapphire I. silarus silarus, the line is (usually) straight and in Trimen's Sapphire I. trimeni it is black and usually jagged. The upperside black margins of I. trimeni and I' silarus silarus are narrower (especially on the hind wing).
 
Sexes differ slightly; female duller blue than male, very broad hind wing upperside red to orange marginal band, stretching to area M1, compared to I. silarus silarus and I. trimeni, in which it is narrower and confined to the anal angle, as it is in male I. silas or both sexes of I. silarus silarus or I. trimeni. Distal part of forewing upperside blue patch suffused with white to a greater or lesser degree, more so than in I. silarus silarus, whose females are often free from white in the upperside blue. Male has conspicuous sex brand at hind wing upperside costa.
 
Males perch atop tall trees during midday hours, preferring those with glossy leaves against which their white underside is not easy to spot. But the white and blue combination is conspicuous in flight. Females are found closer to host plant, and nectaring at low flowers.

Identification
Small butterfly, largest of Brauns's Skolly group. Upperside ground colour buff. Both sexes have wings more pointed than Boland Skolly Thestor protumnus group. Upperside and forewing underside widely bordered with grey-brown and having conspicuous dark-and-light chequered cilia. Upperside and forewing underside have heavy black spotting. Hind wing underside has cryptic pattern of basal, postdiscal and marginal bands of darker scaling on a grey-brown ground. Has a characteristic squarish hind wing underside dark discal mark containing a hooked pale line.
 
Sexually dimorphic. Male smaller than female and much darker, with shorter, more pointed wings. Male forewing has heavy sex brand coloured dark brown to grey-brown in basal part of CuA1 and CuA2, spreading along veins M3, CuA1 and CuA2. Nominate subspecies T. d. dicksoni generally has a duller buff colouration than the other two subspecies. The inner margin of the male's forewing is a darker colour.
 
3 subspp., geographically distinct. The males show more differences than the females.
 
T. dicksoni lives in large colonies, usually in terrain dotted with low 'bossies' or large rocks. Flight is low, fast and sustained, dodging between rocks and plants. They settle often on low vegetation or rocks, but are wary and difficult to approach. The females fly more slowly than the males.

Back to Top
Identification
A distinctive but very variable small Bitter Acraea. Forms protea and monteironis may be mistaken for Common Wanderer Acraea aganice but that species is larger and lacks the pale patch on the inner margin of the forewing.
 
There is slight sexual dimorphism, depending on form. F. esebria has rich tawny orange basal patches, subapical pale patch ochre in male, white in female. In both sexes of f. ertli, similar to f. esebria, the white apical patches are broader and white, and the forewing submarginal patch is a paler tawny orange than the hind wing.
 
Both sexes of f. jacksoni have all pale markings pale tawny orange. F. swynnertoni resembles f. jacksoni but the apical patch is white. These forms are rare and normally only found in Zimbabwe. F. protea male (common in South Africa) has ochreous cream forewing patches; female has subapical patch white. In f. monteironis (both sexes), the patches are all white.
 
The undersides are generally similar in colour to the uppersides; some examples are shown here.
 
Flight slow, easy to approach. Common along forest paths and edges of clearings.
 
As the colour of the underside pale markings tends to follow that of the upperside, not all the undersides are illustrated.

Identification
A medium sized butterfly, this is one of three 'Admirals' having a black upperside ground colour, orange postdiscal transverse forewing band and hind wing marginal band, and hind wing tails. Compared to Southern Short-tailed Admiral Vanessa hippomene hippomene and Northern Short-tailed Admiral V. dimorphica dimorphica, it is larger and has longer tails. The hind wing underside markings are also different. The ground colour is a redder shade of brown and the pale markings are blue as opposed to white.
 
Sexes similar.
 
Flight fast, typical nymphaline short glides interspersed with bursts of rapid wingbeats. Males occupy territories on forest edges and along paths and streams, and perch quite high up (>3m), sallying forth to challenge any other insect invading their domain. May also be found on the ground drinking from wet mud or on animal dung. Shy and wary; if disturbed, will hide in undergrowth or take off into the canopy. Occasionally found in large numbers. Attracted to traps baited with fermenting fruit.

Identification
One of the larger Virachola Playboys. The male is distinctive with his bright orange hind wing upperside and black forewing carrying an orange band at the inner margin. The black is shot with purple which is only visible at very acute angles. The species closest to this one is Black-and-orange Playboy, Virachola dariaves, which lacks the strong orange forewing bar.
 
Underside of both sexes is grey, varying in shade from cool to warm; there are submarginal and postdiscal rows of darker grey and white lines that are 'cut' into segments by the wing veins, and a single darker grey and white mark at the end of the cell in both wings. Unlike other South African Virachola Playboys there are NO dark basal spots on the underside of either wing. Both sexes have a single white-tipped tail at the hind wing anal angle.
 
Sexes differ on the upperside. The female is brown with large discal patches of dove-grey and not pale-blue as in V. antalus or V. dinomenes; female V. dariaves is more blackish and V. dinochares has smaller pale discal patches; V. vansoni females are smaller.
 
Males perch on prominent twigs and leaves on forest edges; conspicuous when chasing other butterflies; usually returns to same perch. Females are found on flowers and close to the host plant.

Back to Top
Identification
Small black-and-orange/red butterflies; uppersides are black with varying degrees of red/orange spots and blotches. Undersides are beautifully camouflaged against their habitat; intricate patterns of black or dark grey on a white or pale grey ground, with submarginal spots in varying shades of red to orange, yellow or white. There are some similar species to Amakosa Rocksitter; Natal Rocksitter Durbania limbata upperside has outer half of hind wing broad red; sexes similar and flies in late summer to autumn, not spring and early summer. And Clark's Rocksitter D. clarki is much smaller and its range does not overlap with that of D. amakosa.
 
Sexually dimorphic. D. a. sagittata is similar to D. a. ayresi and D. a. natalensis but the underside is more yellowish than other subspecies. The male hind wing upperside orange patch is serrated at the distal edge due to the orange colour being extended along the veins.
 
7 subspp., geographically distinct.
 
Rocksitters, as their name suggests, like to sit on rocks; they do this for long periods with wings closed, their cryptic undersides hiding them well against lichen growing on the rock. Occasionally one will take off and patrol the area searching for mates. The flight is weak and fluttering, and they have trouble with headwinds, so they keep low, in the boundary layer. They lack a proboscis and cannot feed as adults, so they are never seen on flowers.

Identification
South Africa's largest Pierid. Male appearance is constant across seasons and subspp., size of black forewing tip being the main variable character. Like Buquet's Vagrant Nepheronia buquetii it has conspicuous green eyes, but the male has a creamy white, not green underside hind wing, and there is a large square spot in the forewing underside tip.
 
Sexually dimorphic in that the female is never greenish white like the male, and always has dark marks along the upperside margins, but not to the same extent as females of Cambridge Vagrant N. Thalassina. There are several female forms. Wet season form females are larger, marginal upperside dark spots larger, hind wing upperside white. Variable extent of basal orange-red on upperside forewing. Dry season form females are smaller, hind wing upperside varies from white, to patches of orange-yellow, to yellow and deep yellow-orange. Yellow hind wing forms rare at coast. F. aurora most typical female form.
 
2 subspp., geographically distinct. Flight fast and direct, stopping seldom, unless at flowers (usually orange or red, but they are fond of Plumbago) to nectar. Any bright red object will attract them.

Identification
Small Hairtail with grey-brown upperside. Pale grey-buff underside crossed by irregular stripes of darker grey, outlined in white. Tends to be flatter grey than others in the group.
 
Sexually dimorphic. Male like Mashuna Hairtail in that upperside brassy violet-blue is only visible from certain angles, but its extent is different; it only covers inner margin and basal part of cell, area 1A+2A to outer margin, and not CuA1 or CuA2. As with female Trimen's and Mashuna A. dulcis dulcis Hairtails, amount of upperside basal blue varies from none at all, to a small basal patch. Underside of both sexes similar, lacks forewing basal black stripe of Black-striped Hairtail A. amarah amarah, with which it often flies.
 
Rapid flight; small size makes it difficult to follow. Whirls around tree tops with other small lycaenids; also around low-growing flowers.

Back to Top
Identification
This is the familiar little white butterfly that migrates across the country in vast numbers almost every year. Upperside similar to Meadow White Pontia helice helice, but can be told apart by the forewing cellular spot, which is bar or dumbbell shaped. Forewing upperside pattern similar to other Belenois species such as Forest White B. zochalia zochalia, and African Veined White B. gidica that have dumb-bell shaped bars at the distal end of the cell. It differs from the Forest White in the lack of pearlescence in the white, and from African Veined White in that it is smaller. The hind wing underside does not have a postdiscal row of sagittate dark marks; the veins are clearly delineated in grey-brown, without the 'streaky' interneural marks. Unlike the Meadow White, the underside dark marks are not a mix of black and yellow scales, and there may be yellow marks but they do not invade the dark areas. Also, females never have yellow wings, as do both the similar Belenois species.
 
Sexes similar, female dark markings brown, black in male. Female with dark marginal borders much broader than male, containing no white marks, dumbbell-shaped dark mark at distal end of forewing upperside cell larger, merges with costal stripe. There are no clear seasonal forms; dry season specimens tend to have reduced dark markings.
 
Flight medium fast, direct, stopping often to feed on flowers. Males are fond of congregating on wet mud. Often found close to the host plants.

Small, brightly coloured Opal. Upperside margins very broad and dark, cilia strongly chequered in orange, black and white. Hind wing anal angle extended to form small tail. Forewing outer margin strongly angled outwards at vein M3, more so than others of the Common Opal group except Brook's Chrysoritis brooksi, Dark C. nigricans, and Adonis C. adonis, Opals; male hind wing basal blue blends with postdiscal black spots on upperside, the black forming a border around blue. Forewing underside has typical 'Copper' pattern of black spots on a pale ground with dark borders. Underside hind wing variegated in shades of brown, ochre, and cream, with conspicuous brassy sagittate markings.
 
Sexes very different. Male orange markings restricted to forewing upperside apex and hind wing submarginal band, female orange ground colour extensive, basal blue patches small but bright.
 
Very fast and elusive flight, hard to follow among its favoured habitat of rocky outcrops on grassy hills. Found in scattered colonies.

Back to Top
Identification
One of a large group of Chrysoritis Opals with blue wing bases and a shimmering, electric opalescent sheen over a varying area of the wings. For Chrysoritis thysbe, amount of blue on upperside varies, in some subspecies almost covering the forewing. Forewing underside has typical 'Copper' pattern of black spots on a pale ground with dark borders. Hind wing underside varies from plain sandy tan to dark brown, to variegated with striae in various shades of reddish-brown, with bands of paler colouring and brassy postdiscal streaks. 'Plain' underside specimens usually have unicoloured cilia; 'variegated' ones dark cilia with pale interneural flecks, appearing 'chequered'.
 
C. t. whitei has upperside solid blue paler than in C. thysbe thysbe or C. thysbe mithras and seldom extends beyond the forewing cell spot. Cilia orange with small pale interneural spots and black vein ends, giving dentate appearance to wing edges. Hind wing underside is variegated in dark brown and cream, with silvery white streaks. Sexes differ. Female has rounder wings, upperside blue restricted to basal 25% of wings, no opalescent sheen. The females of the various races are almost impossible to separate on wing patterns and identification usually requires comparison with males seen at the same locality.
 
7 subspp., not always geographically distinct. Rapid, sustained flight, settling on prominent bushes or rocks. Male intensively territorial on hill tops or sand dunes, regularly patrolling and chasing intruders; Females are found more at random, often on flowers.

Back to Top
Identification
Medium to large butterfly, with weak but sustained fluttering flight, sometimes sailing, at medium height, 2–3m above the ground. Usually found flying alone or in small groups, but may be found in large numbers on wounded plants exuding pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Fond of nectar. This butterfly has complex biogeography; it is widespread across Asia, southern Europe and the whole of Africa. Several variants occur across this range, the relationship between these is the subject of several studies.
 
A form resembling Danaus chrysippus dorippus, the common subspecies in the arid northern and eastern side of Africa, is the rarest in South Africa. The wing tip is orange, lacking the white-spotted black pattern. Typical D. c. dorippus has the orange spreading all the way from the wing bases; form klugii has chocolate-brown basal suffusion and form transiens is similar to klugii but in addition has traces of the white forewing spots seen in D. c. orientis and D. c. alcippus.
 
Further north in Africa, all the forms of D. c. dorippus may be found with the white hind wing patch of D. c. alcippus, but these are not found in SA.
 
It is possible that the appearance of forms resembling D. c. dorippus among the South African D. c. orientis population is a result of edge-of-range interbreeding with those races when climatic conditions make this possible.
 
(E) Male upperside (f. dorippus). (F) Female upperside (f. klugii). (G) Female underside (close to f. transiens). Undersides of (E) and (F) resemble that of (G). Upperside of (G) resembles that of (F) but has the white spots in the forewing apex.

Tiny, dull 'Blue'. Underside warm brownish-grey, with basal and postdiscal series of black spots ringed in creamy-white. Resembles Dark Grass Blue Zizina antanossa, but that butterfly is silvery, steel blue on the upperside; the most obvious difference is the hind wing underside postdiscal series of black spots. In Z. knysna the spots are arranged in an even oval pattern, parallel to the outer margin. In Z. antanossa the spot in area RS is set more basad (towards the body), creating an 'elbow' in the pattern. May also be confused with Gaika Blue Zizula hylax; compared to which the wings are only slightly elongated, and the abdomen is shorter in comparison to the hind wing.
 
Sexually dimorphic. Male upperside dull violaceous-blue, female upperside dark fuscous-brown with variable amount of brighter basal blue.
 
Low, fluttering flight just above the ground, settling often on grass stems or the ground. Most common small Blue, most often on suburban lawns infested with its host plant, a common weed.

Very small, dark Skipper with black-and-white chequered upperside and forewing underside. One of a group of very similar little butterflies, which are difficult to tell apart from the upperside markings. To be reasonably sure of identification a clear view of the hind wing underside is necessary. Compared to Dwarf Sandman Spialia nanus and Common Sandman S. ferax, underside hind wing median band straight, not wavy or curved. Underside hind wing median band constant in width, which sets it apart from Boland Sandman S. sataspes and Wandering Sandman S. depauperata australis. Band not jagged as it is in Confusing Sandman S. confusa confusa or Forest Sandman S. dromus. Star Sandman S. asterodia and Wolkberg Sandman S. secessus also have non-tapering hind wing underside median band, but they have more prominent white banding and spotting in the basal area. Cilia chequered.
 
Sexes similar; females usually larger than males, with larger abdomen.
 
Fast, buzzing, low flight, settling often, wings open. Wary and difficult to approach closely. Male establishes territories on small rocky prominences. Also on flowers, wet mud, and fresh animal droppings.

Back to Top
Identification
Small buff butterfly. Pale buff with no markings on either wing surface. Similar wing shape and size to Millar's Buff, Deloneura millari. Nothing else is known about this species.
 
Three were taken near Fort Bowker in December 1863 by Col. JH Bowker. Two were females and these are usually figured as here; Trimen stated a male to have been taken but its whereabouts are uncertain. The forests near the putative type locality have largely been destroyed so it is unlikely this butterfly will be rediscovered. However, lepidopterists still search, hopefully, for it.
 
Habits unrecorded but likely to be similar to other Deloneura Buffs; shy and retiring habits, slow flight with rapid wingbeats, but making little progress. They gather in groups of several specimens, feeding on honeydew secreted by scale insects quite high in the canopy, 3 to 6 metres up. The butterflies walk slowly around these insects, their camouflaged undersides making them almost impossible to spot. They hardly ever fly unless deliberately flushed, and the best way to see them is to patiently tap the foliage of suitable trees in the habitat. If a group is disturbed they will fly out, with peculiar fast flapping wingbeats. Although the flight is slow, if chased they can put on a respectable turn of speed.

Identification
Small, dark Skipper with black-and-white chequered upperside and forewing underside. One of a group of very similar little butterflies, which are difficult to tell apart from the upperside markings. To be reasonably sure of identification a clear view of the hind wing underside is necessary. Unlike other Sandmen except Wandering Sandman Spialia depauperata australis. cilia not chequered but are plain cream. Unlike that species, has prominent cream-white marginal and submarginal spots on upperside hind wing and forewing. Underside hind wing median band broad, straight, outer edge finely dentate, contrasts with dark ground colour. Only seasonally dimorphic South African Spialia.
 
Sexes similar; females usually larger than males, with larger abdomen.
 
Fast, buzzing, low flight, settling often, wings open. Male hilltops at midday; patrols paths and roads from perches on dry grass stems. Seldom found in numbers.

Identification
Large, bright blue Lepidochrysops Ant Blue. Upperside pale, pearlescent mauve-blue; underside ground colour of both sexes warm fawn-grey, with well-defined rows of white-edged, darker grey spots and basal hind wing black spots. Underside similar to Rossouw's Lepidochrysops rossouwi and Silvery L. glauca Blues, but upperside of both sexes is a deeper, more violaceous blue. Both surfaces of both sexes' hind wings have prominent orange lunules above large black spots at the anal angle. The largest spot is in area CuA1; sometimes the black spot in area 1A+2A is absent but the orange lunule still present. Hind wing carries a small tail at end of vein CuA2. Cilia plain whitish grey.
 
The shade of upperside blue is somewhat variable. Specimens from arid areas tend to be a paler shade of mauve-blue but are never ice-blue as in L. glauca.
 
Sexually dimorphic; male upperside plain blue with thin fuscous-grey margins. Female upperside has variable extent of basal and discal mauve-blue on a fuscous-grey ground, whitish sagittate hind wing submarginal marks. Female also has larger dark spot at the distal end of the cell than the male, and in some specimens there is a postdiscal row of faint white-edged grey spots corresponding in position to those on the underside.
 
Most males fly rapidly, erratically and randomly over Grassland or bushveld, colonies not concentrated, males congregating near prominent trees. Where the larval host plant is Salvia, they exhibit more colonial behaviour, and are found at high density in relatively small areas.

Medium–small dark Skipper. Upperside blackish brown with greenish yellow hairs and pale spots. Upperside ground colour brown. Has three tiny hyaline subapical spots, and small hyaline spots in areas M2, M3 and CuA1. Always has two small hyaline spots in forewing cell. Sexes differ in markings in CuA2. Underside olive-green; five small white discal spots on hind wing in areas CuA1 to Rs. Cilia plain pale grey-brown. Similar to some of the Borbo Swifts that have yellow or green hairs on the upperside. Rusty Swift Borbo detecta has distinctly reddish yellow ochre hairs. Olive-haired Swift B. borbonica has olive-green hairs but the hind wing underside black-ringed white spots are distinctive. Twin Swift Larsenia gemella has yellowish to greenish ochre hairs, but has only three hind wing underside discal spots.
 
Sexually dimorphic. Male has white forewing discal sex brand diagonally crossing CuA2. Female lacks sex brand; larger than male, wings more elongated, forewing upperside has hyaline discal spot in CuA2, white spot in CuA1. Apart from the different colour of the male sex brand, the number of discal hind wing underside spots distinguishes this species from the very similar Black-branded Swift Pelopidas mathias mathias.
 
Males are territorial on hilltops, at edges of forest, along roads, paths or streams, chasing intruding males. Flight rapid, but settling often on low shrubs, grass stems or rocks; fairly easy to approach. Females are more sedentary, around flowers.

Identification
Unmistakable medium sized dark green butterfly, with red-brown 'dead leaf' underside. South Africa's only Euryphura species. Upperside has black mottling, hence common name. The only species that could be confused with it (habits are similar) is Guineafowl, Hamanumida daedalus, but that butterfly has a grey upperside covered in white dots.
 
Sexually dimorphic; female larger, bluer than male, upperside and underside forewings with white apical spots.
 
Low, fast, gliding flight a few centimetres above the ground, wings open with occasional rapid wingbeats. Usually seen on shady forest paths. Jinks into undergrowth to avoid pursuit. Reddish underside conspicuous as wings flicker in flight. Usually encountered singly. They settle readily, wings-open but are very wary and difficult to approach.
 
Seldom seen on flowers; both sexes fond of rotting fallen fruit and wads of chewed sugar cane discarded by people. They come to fruit baited traps.

Medium–large white Pierid. Invasive alien species that was first seen in the W
Cape in the early 1990's and has spread northwards since. The only similarly sized Pierid
that may fly with it is Buquet's Vagrant Nepheronia buquetii. Can be told apart by
eyes not bright green; upperside colour pure white with no green tinge;
forewing underside has black discal spots; and lacks hind wing cell spot. Underside hind wing may appear green but this is as a result of fine mix of black and yellow scales; the colour appears more grey-green.
 
Sexually dimorphic; male upperside white, black marginal band apically sprinkled with grey scales, small black spot at end of hind wing costa. Female has two large upperside discal spots, one below the other, in lower middle forewing, where male only has underside spots. Late summer and winter specimens have more grey scaling in black forewing apical band.

Eyes never bright green as in that species, and hind wing underside discal spot, if present, is pale, not brown.
 
The male has only one form, the pale blue-green nominate. Females have three forms; the bright yellow nominate, pale yellow f. hyblaea and male-like f. pyrene.
 
Flight sustained and powerful, covering large distances, restless and seldom settling for long in the same place. Migrating swarms may occur with many millions of individuals all flying in the same direction. Thousands may be seen drinking from mud puddles in hot weather, and both sexes are often seen nectaring at flowers. They show a distinct preference for red and orange blooms. In the dry season, they may be found hibernating between the leaves of bushes and creepers. The yellow nominate females show are often found resting among yellowed leaves.

Hind wing underside sometimes with large ocelli in apical and anal areas, underside forewing basal rust-red patch reaches as far as apical ocellus; hind wing underside grey-brown ground colour irrorated with tiny short dark red-brown striae grouped into ill-defined bands.
 
S. w. williami is smaller than S. w. wichgrafi but larger than S. w. grisea. Ground colour darker brown. The upperside red patches are a deeper red, and usually smaller. Ocelli ringed with greyish-ochre with reduced encircling ring. The hind wing underside is more closely striated giving a darker appearance. Sexes similar, female heavier, with stouter abdomen, and wings more elongated. Female has more sedentary habits.
 
Slow, jinking flight, settling often on rocks, jerkliy opening and closing wings. Visits flowers, where it tends to be less wary.

Identification
Small, bright orange Charaxes. Superficially similar to Club-tailed Charaxes Charaxes zoolina f. neanthes, but with black spots, not red-brown, and has two tails in both sexes. Tails are sharply pointed, not clubbed. Nominate C. j. jahlusa is paler than the other two subspp., particularly in the female, with comparatively heavy dark markings. The underside hind wing has little to no orange-tawny colour in the submarginal band.
 
Sexes similar, but male has narrower, more triangular wings.
 
Although this is a small Charaxes it lacks nothing in speed of flight or, in the male, pugnacity. Males form territories on hilltops, or in flat country, around prominent bushes and trees. They pursue any butterfly (or other flying creature) that ventures nearby. Females are found close to the host plants, or wandering around searching for males.
 
Both sexes are attracted to rotting fruit, animal dung and sap leaking from wounded trees.

Tiny blue or black butterfly. Underside resembles that of Common Smoky Blue
Euchrysops malathana but a much smaller butterfly; orange anal lunule in
    CuA1 and sometimes CuA2 has a marginal black spot edged with
        pale metallic blue-green on both wing surfaces. The orange may spread
    into M3 and 1A+2A, but is not well-defined. On the underside the basal
    black spots are smaller than in Common Smoky Blue, the white-edged spots in the
    cell are reduced to white-edged lines, and the postdiscal series of marks are
    narrower and appear as a broken white-edged line. Where
    Euchrysops have a well-defined row of postdiscal white sagittate marks,
    Cupreous Blue has blunt white arches. Females resemble both sexes of Grass Jewel,
    Chilades trochilus, but that butterfly has three well-defined orange lunules
        with black spots in M3, CuA1 and CuA2, and sometimes a fourth in M2.
 
Sexually dimorphic. Eicochrysops messapus mahallakoeana is blue on upperside with pinkish-copper blush. Female upperside black, hind wing has black and orange anal lunule varying in size. Underside of both sexes and both subspp. grey with black spots.

Dull blue and brown 'blue'. Upperside dull violaceous blue with fuscous-brown margins. Dark hind wing upperside anal lunule faint or absent. No forewing upperside cell spot. Underside of both sexes pale, warm shade of brownish-grey; postmedian series of black spots in forewing are circular to slightly oval, thinly outlined in white; small spots on edges of discal area of hind wing, and indistinct pale hind wing postdiscal band running parallel to outer margin. Distal to this is a series of darker grey sagittate marks. Has a very small black anal spot in area CuA1, with some metallic blue scaling and a small orange lunule. This distinguishes it from Brinkman's Blue Orachrysops brinkmani, in which this spot is always absent. Cilia plain brownish grey. Size variable, autumn brood often has dwarfs.
 
Sexually dimorphic. Male upperside dull violet-blue, marginal borders broad, grey-brown. Female marginal borders much wider, blue variable in extent, tending to be brighter, less violet than male.
 
Flight erratic, fairly slow and close to the ground, but fast if disturbed. Males patrol a 'beat' along a contour or line of taller bushes in the fynbos, setting occasionally but wary and difficult to approach.

Small black-and-red butterfly; upperside black with marginal band of elongated red spots. Outer half of hind wing is red. Underside cryptic, well camouflaged among pink granite rocks. Smaller than similar Amakosa Rocksitter Durbania amakosa, with forewing red band closer to margin. Male upperside has glossy sheen.
 
Sexes very similar. Female larger than male with broader wings and a larger abdomen.
 
Rocksitters, as their name suggests, like to sit on rocks; they do this for long periods with wings closed, their cryptic undersides hiding them well against lichen growing on the rock. Occasionally one will take off and patrol the area searching for mates. The flight is weak and fluttering, and they have trouble with headwinds, so they keep low, in the boundary layer. They lack a proboscis and cannot feed as adults, so they are never seen on flowers.

Back to Top
Identification
Tiny lycaenid; when examined close up the only species that can be confused with it is Brilliant Gem, Chloroselas pseudozeritis pseudozeritis. Apart from the differences in the male uppersides, the undersides of both sexes can be told apart by the pale, grey-buff colour of Purple Gem, carrying smaller, less well-defined brassy centred spots. Each hind wing carries a pair of thin tails with white tips at the anal angle.
 
Sexually dimorphic. The male upperside has a deep purple sheen over a dark brown ground colour. This is less metallic than the blue-green of Brilliant Gem, but as in that species, the colour is only visible when viewed under light coming from the correct acute angle. Female is plain dullbrown above, lacking the buff or blue scaling of Brilliant Gem.
 
Habits similar to Bars, High-fliers and Scarlets but small size and rapid flight makes them difficult to spot amongst the hordes of tiny Babul Blues (Azanus sp.) and Hairtails (Anthene sp.) with which they habitually fly. Occasionally in strong colonies, but more often found singly.

Large, conspicuous butterfly. The male is one of our most distinctive species, coloured in pale sulphur-yellow with black marginal borders and hind wing submarginal band. The amount of black patterning varies with the seasons.
 
Sexually dimorphic and polymorphic. Female has several forms, mimicking various species of Danainae.
 
Often seen flying fast across country or nectaring. Females are shyer and more retiring than the males, most often found close to the host plants.
 
Male dry season form cenea, hind wing submarginal band may be broken into blotches. Wet season form tibullus is darker. In the extreme wet season form, discopunctata, there is a black spot in the forewing cell. (A) Male upperside. (B) Male underside. All form cenea.

Small coppery Opal. Upperside bright coppery-orange with black marginal borders and sparse black forewing spots; largest of which is at the distal end of the cell. Similar to many other Opals with plain copper uppersides but most are not found in the same areas. May be confused with Lydenburg Opal Chrysoritis aethon, but smaller, shade of orange ground colour less shiny and red, fewer black spots on forewing, none on hind wing. Also resembles Tsomo River Opal C. lyncurium, but hind wing upperside costa less heavily marked with black. Another species that flies in the same areas is Burnished Opal C. chrysaor, but that species has a curved line of black discal spots on the hind wing. Underside forewing has typical 'Copper' pattern of black spots on a pale ground with dark borders. Underside hind wing is red-brown to greenish-buff crossed by lines of darker brown.
 
Sexes similar, female paler orange; not as metallic as the male. Forewing outer margin more rounded. Underside hind wing in female usually has a more greenish tinge.

Small black-and-orange/red butterflies; uppersides are black with varying degrees of red/orange spots and blotches. Undersides are beautifully camouflaged against their habitat; intricate patterns of black or dark grey on a white or pale grey ground, with submarginal spots in varying shades of red to orange, yellow or white. There are some similar species to Amakosa Rocksitter; Natal Rocksitter Durbania limbata upperside has outer half of hind wing broad red; sexes similar and flies in late summer to autumn, not spring and early summer. And Clark's Rocksitter D. clarki is much smaller and its range does not overlap with that of D. amakosa.
 
Sexually dimorphic. D. a. flavida is similar to D. a. natalensis but the upperside markings are more yellowish The underside hind wing submarginal spots are yellow-orange, not red.
 
7 subspp., geographically distinct.
 
Rocksitters, as their name suggests, like to sit on rocks; they do this for long periods with wings closed, their cryptic undersides hiding them well against lichen growing on the rock. Occasionally one will take off and patrol the area searching for mates. The flight is weak and fluttering, and they have trouble with headwinds, so they keep low, in the boundary layer. They lack a proboscis and cannot feed as adults, so they are never seen on flowers.

Identification
Distinctive small butterfly with brown upperside crossed by orange or buff bands, and unmistakable long palpi forming a 'snout', hence the common name. Underside very variable, from blackish through wide range of browns and greys to buff, and mottled with varying numbers of darker markings. Specimens flying in the wet season have heavier underside patterning than dry season individuals. Its tendency to swarm, small size and brown colouration makes it similar to the Tree Nymphs Sevenia spp, but the long 'snout' tells it apart, as well as the upperside patterning.
 
Sexes similar, female with broader wings.
 
Weak, flitting flight, settling often and sitting very still, protected from attack by its excellent camouflage. Frequents forest canopy, flying lower to sit on tree branches and wet mud, where it is wary and difficult to approach, flitting off to sit a few metres away. Occasionally encountered in migrating swarms.

Forewing underside has typical 'Copper' pattern of black spots on a pale ground with dark borders. Hind wing underside similar to Beulah's Opal; even less variegated, sometimes appearing flat buff, with only faint brown variegation and red streaks along the veins.
 
Sexes differ. Female has almost no basal blue, hind wing upperside postdiscal black spots small.
 
Found in small colonies at the top of steep rocky talus slopes below huge mountain cliffs; males can be seen flying up and down inaccessible vertical gullies. Females are found in hollows among the talus where the host plant grows. Their rapid flight and wary nature makes puts them among the most difficult butterflies to catch or photograph.

Flight fast, typical nymphaline short glides interspersed with bursts of rapid wingbeats. Males occupy territories on forest edges and along paths and streams, and perch two or three metres up, sallying forth to challenge any other insect invading their domain. May also be found on the ground drinking from wet mud or on animal dung. Shy and wary; if disturbed, will hide in undergrowth or take off into the canopy. Occasionally found in large numbers.

Submarginal band of dark spots that extend to the inner margin in Holmes's and Stephen's Skollies stop at CuA1, in this species. This is unfortunately not visible on live insects as the hind wing costa usually covers it.
 
Sexes similar. Females occasionally show upperside very dark brown markings on both wings; underside, which is often paler, less well marked than that of the male. Male has grey-brown tridentate sex brand, restricted to origin of veins M3, CuA1 and CuA2. This is conspicuous against the dark grey-brown ground colour.

Identification
Very small butterfly with patterns of orange or orange-red and black on the upperside; has a greater or lesser amount of black in the centre of the forewing depending on sex and subspecies. Underside irrorated with black, grey and white with tiny submarginal spots on the hind wing. The other Rocksitters that fly in the same areas are Boland Rocksitter Durbaniopsis saga and two of the races of Amakosa Rocksitter, Durbania amakosa amakosa and D. a. penningtoni. Durbaniella clarki is generally smaller than either, although small males of D. saga can be in the same size range. It can immediately be distinguished from that species by the underside; D. clarki lacks the conspicuous dark and light bands of D. saga. Compared to D. amakosa, the differences are sex-related. Females of D. amakosa are always much larger and have more extensive, better defined patterns of orange or orange-red and black on the upperside. D. a. amakosa males have discrete orange-red spots on the upperside. D. a. penningtoni males have very similar upperside markings to D. clarki but they are more of a yellow-buff colour and the hind wing base is dark, .
 
Variable degree of sexual dimorphism depending on subspecies. D. c. jenniferae upperside orange lighter and more extensive than in D. c. clarki or D. c. phaea, but not to the same extent as in D. c. belladonna. In the male, the forewing postdiscal orange spots are arrowhead shaped, especially those near the anal angle. The forewing discal dark patch is reduced but always present in both sexes.
 
4 subspp., geographically distinct; varying in markings and colour.
 
Rocksitters, as their name suggests, like to sit on rocks; they do this for long periods with wings closed, their cryptic undersides hiding them well against lichen growing on the rock. Occasionally one will take off and patrol the area searching for mates. The flight is weak and fluttering, and they have trouble with headwinds, so they keep low, in the boundary layer.

Underside of both sexes similar to Scarce Forest Emperor C. etesipe tavetensis, but with grey, not white, flash on hind wing costa.
 
Fast, agile flight; males are very territorial, hilltopping and perching on prominent twigs on bushes, and pursuing any butterfly (or other flying creature) that ventures nearby. Females fly lower down, around clumps of bush, settling on leaves.
 
Both sexes are attracted to rotting fruit, animal dung and sap leaking from wounded trees. More-or-less restricted to wooded Savanna and forest.

It is closely mimicked by the False Wanderer Pseudacraea eurytus imitator, even to the extent of having the same sexual dimorphism and high flight. They can be told apart by the black spots at the base of the underside wings. The 'true' Wanderer only has them on the hind wing. P. eurytus imitator has them on both wings.
 
Sexually dimorphic; male with wings narrower than female, and yellow instead of white wing markings.
 
Male strongly territorial; settles high-up, chases off settling intruders. Female fond of flowers, often found near host plants. Their flight pattern is more 'fluttering' than flat-winged soaring as in P. eurytus imitator, .

Identification
Very small, dark Skipper with black-and-white chequered upperside and forewing underside. One of a group of very similar little butterflies, which are difficult to tell apart from the upperside markings. To be reasonably sure of identification a clear view of the hind wing underside is necessary. Forewing upperside central cell spot closer to discocellular spot than basal spot, which sets it apart from other Spialia species with three cell spots, except Grassveld Sandman S. agylla. Underside hind wing pale median band jagged-edged but complete. Runs parallel to series of pale basal spots, creating two jagged, black-edged ochreous-brown bands. Cilia chequered. Differs from Grassveld Sandman, whose median band is much more irregular, a series of white spots that may or may not be joined. The part of the band in the cell connects via a dark edged white line to a submarginal spot in area M2. In this respect it resembles the much smaller Mite Sandman S. paula but in that butterfly the median band is broken into spots.
 
Sexes similar; females usually larger than males, with larger abdomen.
 
Fast, buzzing, low flight, settling often, wings open. Male hilltops, more often on grassy than wooded hillsides, and patrols the area. Both sexes fond of flowers, seldom on mud. Male often found sitting on the ground, female scarcer, most often near host plants.

Identification
Probably the most spectacular 'blue' Opal. Forewing outer margin strongly angled outwards at vein M3 as in Dark Opal Chrysoritis nigricans; male forewing upperside markings also similar, basal blue less extensive. Male upperside has electric blue opalescent sheen, penetrating black forewing apex as in Dark Opal, but hind wing upperside orange-red postdiscal band much broader, dark wing base covered with silvery blue. Forewing underside has typical 'Copper' pattern of black spots on a pale ground with dark borders. Underside hind wing similar to Dark Opal.
 
Sexes dimorphic; female similar to Uranus Opal C. uranus, black postdiscal hind wing upperside spots placed more basally, leaving wider orange submarginal area free from spotting; underside hind wing redder.
 
2 subspp., geographically distinct. Males usually found in dry riverbeds and gullies at medium altitude, below ridges where Uranus Opal C. uranus flies; C. adonis aridimontis males found on prominences. They fly rapidly up and down patrolling their territories. Females are found away from male territory, often on flowers with females of Uranus Opal.

Small buff butterfly. Similar to Kaplan's Skolly Thestor kaplani but with elongated forewings, less convex outer margin, and more pointed forewings. The male's wing tip black does not invade the discal area to the same extent, so that the typical Thestor spotting is more visible. Underside hind wing pale grey to brown with indistinct basal band and faint submarginal row of 'V' shaped marks joined into a line. Has a dark, zigzag median line bent towards the margin between veins M1 and M3.
 
Sexually dimorphic. Male has golden-buff wing bases and heavy black wing tips; tridentate sex brand is also golden-buff; restricted to veins M3, CuA1 and CuA2. Underside hind wing pale grey with well-defined median line. Female is a more typical buff Thestor type, with more pale colouring on wings. Dark bands heavy; shade of buff varies from dull buff to bright orange-buff. Underside hind wing pale brown with fainter median line than male; cf. female T. compassbergae and T. pringlei.
 
T. camdeboo lives in colonies, usually on high, north-east facing mountain slopes, on shale covered slopes or grassy areas. Fast, low flight, settling on rocks or low plants. Males form territories in open areas. Difficult to follow in flight; when settled, superbly camouflaged underside hard to spot.

Bright blue Lepidochrysops Ant Blue. Smaller than Brauer's Blue Lepidochrysops braueri, which it resembles, but lacks silvery, powdery hue; ground colour more violaceous, marginal borders broader. Female ground colour darker. Both sexes with forewing apex more rounded. Male sometimes has dark postmedian spots as in Oosthuizen's Blue. Underside hind wing has very large white-edged dark spots almost obscuring ground colour, wide band of postdiscal sagittate spots.
 
Sexes differ in that the female upperside, as in many of the genus Lepidochrysops, has a row of dark postdiscal spots on the forewing, and a dark band crossing the hind wing, corresponding to the dark underside spotting. Some males, however, also show this characteristic.
 
Males congregate around rocky crags and ridges in warmer hours, rapidly circling and patrolling area in company of other Blues. Female flight more random; sometimes visits crags in search of mate.

The only South African Charaxes to have named seasonal forms. The male is, with Pearl Charaxes Charaxes varanes varanes, the only South African Charaxes to have only one tail.
 
Sexes similar The male has wings more triangular than female, and only one spatulate tail (where the female has two tails).
 
Seasonally dimorphic. The whitish wet season form f. zoolina is unmistakable. In flight, the orange and brown dry season form f. neanthes is similar to the Pearl-spotted Charaxes C. jahlusa, but its dark markings are red-brown, not black. Occasional specimens with colouring intermediate between the two forms have been recorded.
 
The species may swarm in warmer areas. It is slower-flying than other Charaxes, the males forming territories around a tree or clump of shrubs, and flying around them for hours. Females are most often found near the host plants. Both seasonal forms may fly together.
 
Both sexes are attracted to rotting fruit, animal dung and sap leaking from wounded trees. They are also frequently found nectaring on flowers.

Identification
Small to medium sized orange butterfly with black bands and spots. One of two species of Joker found in South Africa. Conspicuous, bright orange, small butterfly. Can be told apart from Common Joker Byblia anvatara acheloia by row of black spots in hind wing upperside discal band. Underside shows considerable seasonal variation; dry season form badiata hind wing underside crossed with chocolate-brown bands and yellow-white spots. More common wet season form f. ilithyia has yellow-ochre hind wing on underside, basal spots black, submarginal band black with small white spots. Other superficially similar species are Gaudy Commodore Precis octavia sesamus f. natalensis, and Pirate Catacroptera cloanthe. The former lacks the pale underside markings and the latter has a plain underside.
 
Sexes similar in markings: male much brighter orange than female, edges of black marks better defined.
 
Active, erratic flight, usually not more than 1–2m above the ground, in open grassy areas and between bushes. Frequently settles on plants but seldom flowers, wings open, slowly 'pumping' them. Like B. anvatara acheloia and Danaus chrysippus, commonly seen sucking grass flowerheads, behaviour that is not currently understood as grasses do not produce nectar. Both sexes are attracted to fallen fruit and come readily to traps baited with this.

One of a large group of Chrysoritis Opals with blue wing bases and a shimmering, electric opalescent sheen over a varying area of the wings. For Chrysoritis thysbe, amount of blue on upperside varies, in some subspecies almost covering the forewing. Forewing underside has typical 'Copper' pattern of black spots on a pale ground with dark borders. Hind wing underside varies from plain sandy tan to dark brown, to variegated with striae in various shades of reddish-brown, with bands of paler colouring and brassy postdiscal streaks. 'Plain' underside specimens usually have unicoloured cilia; 'variegated' ones dark cilia with pale interneural flecks, appearing 'chequered'.
 
settling on prominent bushes or rocks. Male intensively territorial on hill tops or sand dunes, regularly patrolling and chasing intruders; Females are found more at random, often on flowers.
 
C. t. psyche nearly always has the plain underside and unicoloured cilia, with hind wing underside silver streaks absent. Male upperside has extensive blue, paler than in C. thysbe bamptoni, also with dark margins. Hind wing upperside has restricted basal blue and tiny or absent dark discal spots. Sexes differ. Female has rounder wings, upperside blue restricted to basal 25% of wings, no opalescent sheen. The females of the various races are almost impossible to separate on wing patterns and identification usually requires comparison with males seen at the same locality.

Identification
Tiny grey-blue or brown-black butterfly. Very different in appearance to Eicochrysops hippocrates, the male in particular being very distinctive. The underside ground colour is pale greyish-white with black basal spots; very different to any other small blue found in South Africa. Like E. hippocrates it has small lines in each underside cell, but the postdiscal and submarginal rows of spots are reduced to lines of thin, elongated grey spots. Both wing surfaces of the hind wing carry a small marginal black spot in area CuA2, edged basally with an orange lunule.
 
Sexually dimorphic. Male upperside black-brown with bold white forewing apical tip; female resembles a tiny version of Barker's Smoky Blue Euchrysops barkeri but much smaller, upperside much brighter pale metallic blue, marginal borders broad, grey-brown.
 
Flight unhurried. Found in wet, marshy areas, especially where animals have stirred up mud at the water's edge; seldom strays far from water. Females usually restricted to the vicinity of the host plant.

Identification
Medium sized Charaxes. Dark brown upperside ground colour, with tawny orange median band and row of marginal spots; latter whitish at anal corner of hind wing. Underside metallic grey, with white median bands; basal areas patterned in dark red outlined with black-edged white. Similar to Foxy Charaxes Charaxes saturnus saturnus, but the geographic distribution is very different. The grey areas on the underside are a paler shade of silver than in C. saturnus, and the underside basal areas are patterned in dark red not ochre-red. The only other similar large butterfly found in its haunts is Table Mountain Beauty Aeropetes tulbaghia. It also has orange median bands, but the absence of large hind wing marginal ocelli immediately tells C. pelias apart.
 
Sexes similar, females larger than males, not found on hilltops, but more often close to the host plants.
 
Male has powerful flight and frequents hill and mountain tops; settles on prominent twigs and rocks, and sets off in pursuit of other butterflies. Not as fond of rotten fruit as other Charaxes, so it is difficult to attract that way.

Medium sized canopy butterfly, dark with prominent paler markings. Resembles distasteful members of the genus Amauris but generally so, the resemblance is not exact and the colours do not exactly match.
 
Forewing marks of P. l. tarquinia smaller than in P. l. expansa. Pale markings vary from white to pale yellow-ochre.
 
Sexes alike, female with markings identical to male, but with rounder wings.
 
Floating, sailing flight, wings open flat, with infrequent rapid wingbeats. This distinguishes them from the more fluttering flight of the models. If disturbed they can put on a turn of speed. Male territorial, perching on prominent forest-edge leaves, chasing intruders. If chased away he usually returns to the same perch. The female is less active. Both sexes are often seen nectaring on flowering trees. Occasionally found low down, drinking at mud puddles.

Deep electric blue opalescent sheen spreads outside the 'solid' blue over the black outer forewing margin, giving the impression of an all-blue forewing when viewed from certain angles. Forewing underside has typical 'Copper' pattern of black spots on a pale ground with dark borders. Hind wing underside of both sexes somewhat like Lysander Pan Opal Chrysoritis pan lysander or Psyche Common Opal C. thysbe psyche - pale buff with patches of rich red-brown, appearing 'streaky'; cilia conspicuously chequered.
 
Sexes differ. Female upperside resembles Beaufort Opal.
 
Males adopt territories in riverbeds and gullies, perching on a prominent twig or leaf, and flying off rapidly to chase any intruders. Females are more sedentary, found on flowers.

Identification
Small butterfly conspicuously buff upperside and forewing underside, bordered with grey-brown and having chequered cilia, the amount of contrast varying. Colour varies between subspecies, and within populations can range from bright cartridge-buff to a darker tawny-buff. Upperside and forewing underside carry variable number of dark spots, depending on subspecies and varying within populations. Hind wing underside has cryptic pattern of basal, postdiscal and marginal bands of darker scaling on a grey-brown ground; depth of colour varies between subspecies.
 
Slight sexual dimorphism. Male smaller than female. Male upperside buff with grey-brown margins and rows of black spots; forewing carries prominent sex brand, coloured dark brown to grey-brown in basal part of CuA1 and CuA2, spreading along veins M3, CuA1 and CuA2. Female usually brighter buff than male, with rounded not pointed wings. T. p. terblanchei is the smallest subspecies. The upperside is the brightest buff of the three, and has the palest upperside wing margins.
 
3 subspp., geographically distinct; varying in size and colour.
 
T. protumnus lives in discrete colonies in flat country and on hillsides. These probably coincide with colonies of the host ant, a Pugnacious Ant, Anaplolepis sp. Flight is low and fluttering but can be fast and sustained. Males are territorial and congregate around patches of bare gravelly or sandy soil; females fly around inspecting plants for the presence of their host ants. Should she find this she will lay one or two eggs.

Tiny to small buff butterfly. Resembles Pennington's Buff Cnodontes penningtoni; very similar; only reliably distinguished by genitalic dissection, but usually has pale grey irroration on dark forewing tip. Also resembles Lipara Buff Baliochila lipara and Common Buff B. aslanga but both sexes have one dark costal mark just outside the forewing cell. No dark costal marks at the base of the forewing as in Baliochila spp. Hind wing underside has orange-red marks on a brown ground; instead of being lines of prominent discrete spots as in B. aslanga they form bands. These may be indistinct or even absent.
 
Sexes similar.
 
Weak, fluttering flight. Usually flies high in canopy, sometimes many seen flying together. Favours spaces with spindly saplings under large trees on forest edges. Settles on twigs, wings closed; periodically suddenly opening them. When doing this it resembles a tiny yellowed leaf waving in the breeze. Occasionally found roosting communally. Female flies lower, searching for oviposition sites. Often found in groups, imbibing honeydew from scale insects on twigs or leaves.

Medium–small white Pierid with red wing tips and varying degree of black wing markings. Underside varies in ground colour, and amount of prominent black scaling along veins, but both wings usually have a distinct black cell spot. Larger than similar Common Orange Tip Colotis evenina evenina; male upperside wing tips red, not orange; female lacks square, blocky marks on forewing underside. Compared to Smoky Orange Tip C. euippe omphale, it lacks bulge in basal dark edge of orange tip.
 
Sexually dimorphic. Generally, male apical third of forewing upperside vermilion, more or less edged with black, has black marginal hind wing border or spots, black 'moustache' mark formed by black basal edge of forewing and hind wing costal edge. Female forewing upperside apical patch red to orange-yellow, with black veins, edged with black, black band proximal to patch or crossing it. Variable black basal forewing patch and black marginal borders on both wings, squared-off hind wing black discal band angled at M3.
 
Fast, low flight; wary and easily disturbed; hard to approach closely unless chilled by cool conditions. Male usually follows a 'beat' around a selected patch of bush. Both sexes often seen on flowers.

South Africa's largest Pierid. Male appearance is constant across seasons and subspp., size of black forewing tip being the main variable character. Like Buquet's Vagrant Nepheronia buquetii it has conspicuous green eyes, but the male has a creamy white, not green underside hind wing, and there is a large square spot in the forewing underside tip.
 
Sexually dimorphic in that the female is never greenish white like the male, and always has dark marks along the upperside margins, but not to the same extent as females of Cambridge Vagrant N. Thalassina. There are several female forms. Wet season form females are larger, marginal upperside dark spots larger, hind wing upperside white. Variable extent of basal orange-red on upperside forewing. Dry season form females are smaller, hind wing upperside varies from white, to patches of orange-yellow, to yellow and deep yellow-orange. Yellow hind wing forms rare at coast. F. aurora most typical female form.
 
2 subspp., geographically distinct. Flight fast and direct, stopping seldom, unless at flowers (usually orange or red, but they are fond of Plumbago) to nectar. Any bright red object will attract them.
 
N. argia variegata: Male has larger black forewing tip than N. a. varia. Females do not have the yellow or orange hind wing upperside of N. a. varia.

Back to Top
Identification
Small Charaxes. Male has shiny black upperside. Forewing margin has bluish-grey sheen and paler interneural smudges at the margin. The male is very similar to Van Son's Charaxes Charaxes vansoni. It tends to have a slightly greater extent of silvery sheen along the underside hind wing costa, reaching the margin. But they are only reliably separable on genitalic dissection. Female is distinctive, resembling a male Large Blue Emperor, but not as large or robust.
 
Sexually dimorphic, only one female form, unlike C. ethalion ethalion.
 
Although this is a small Charaxes it lacks nothing in speed of flight or, in the male, pugnacity. Males form territories on hilltops, or in flat country, around prominent bushes and trees. They pursue any butterfly (or other flying creature) that ventures nearby. Females are found close to the host plants, or wandering around searching for males. Both sexes are often found drinking on wet mud.
 
Both sexes are attracted to rotting fruit, animal dung and sap leaking from wounded trees.

Identification
Small buff butterfly. Similar to Kaplan's Skolly Thestor kaplani but with elongated forewings, less convex outer margin, and more pointed forewings. The male's wing tip black does not invade the discal area to the same extent, so that the typical Thestor spotting is more visible. Underside hind wing pale grey to brown with indistinct basal band and faint submarginal row of 'V' shaped marks joined into a line. Has a dark, zigzag median line bent towards the margin between veins M1 and M3.
 
Sexually dimorphic. Male has orange-buff wing bases and heavy black wing tips; usual discal spotting merged into wingtip; tridentate sex brand is large and grey-brown; covering basal part of CuA1 and CuA2, spreading along veins M3, CuA1 and CuA2. Underside hind wing pale grey with well-defined median line. Female is a more typical buff Thestor type, with more pale colouring on wings. Dark bands heavy; shade of buff varies from dull buff to bright orange-buff. Underside hind wing pale brown with fainter median line than male.
 
T. pringlei lives in colonies, usually on high, north-east facing mountain slopes, on flat, shale covered areas with shallow gullies and many small bushes. Fast, low flight, settling on rocks or low plants. Males form territories in open areas. Difficult to follow in flight; when settled, superbly camouflaged underside hard to spot. Usually found in groups of three or four, but in the right conditions can occur in large numbers. Females patrol the area, searching for suitable oviposition sites; these may be isolated twigs and dry grass stems in the middle of a dry area.

Male 18–24 mm female 18–26 mm.
Back to Top
Identification
Very small butterfly with patterns of orange or orange-red and black on the upperside; has a greater or lesser amount of black in the centre of the forewing depending on sex and subspecies. Underside irrorated with black, grey and white with tiny submarginal spots on the hind wing. The other Rocksitters that fly in the same areas are Boland Rocksitter Durbaniopsis saga and two of the races of Amakosa Rocksitter, Durbania amakosa amakosa and D. a. penningtoni. Durbaniella clarki is generally smaller than either, although small males of D. saga can be in the same size range. It can immediately be distinguished from that species by the underside; D. clarki lacks the conspicuous dark and light bands of D. saga. Compared to D. amakosa, the differences are sex-related. Females of D. amakosa are always much larger and have more extensive, better defined patterns of orange or orange-red and black on the upperside. D. a. amakosa males have discrete orange-red spots on the upperside. D. a. penningtoni males have very similar upperside markings to D. clarki but they are more of a yellow-buff colour and the hind wing base is dark, .
 
Variable degree of sexual dimorphism depending on subspecies. D. c. belladonna is the most intensely coloured of all four subspecies. The male is similar to that of D. c. jenniferae but the arrowhead shaped forewing postdiscal spots are more elongated. The female upperside is almost totally orange with a narrow black border; the apical spots are reduced or absent and the dark discal patch is reduced to a few dark spots at the end of the cell.
 
4 subspp., geographically distinct; varying in markings and colour.
 
Rocksitters, as their name suggests, like to sit on rocks; they do this for long periods with wings closed, their cryptic undersides hiding them well against lichen growing on the rock. Occasionally one will take off and patrol the area searching for mates. The flight is weak and fluttering, and they have trouble with headwinds, so they keep low, in the boundary layer. They lack a proboscis and cannot feed as adults, so they are never seen on flowers.

Back to Top
Identification
Medium–small white Pierid with orange wing tips and varying degree of black wing markings. Uniquely amongst Orange Tips, Smoky Orange Tip Colotis euippe omphale has a thickening in the black basal edge of the forewing orange tip. In some forms it is very obvious, in others it may be very slight or even reduced to an 'elbow' in the basal edge.
 
Sexes similar, white ground colour, black-edged red-orange forewing tips on upperside.
 
Fast, low flight. Both sexes fly at random, often seen on flowers.
 
Seasonally polymorphic. There are many forms of both sexes, varying according to the seasons. There are many intermediates and the forms shown here only approximate the 'type' for each; the variation is gradual and no two individuals are exactly alike.
 
The 'normal' wet season form in the eastern part of its range, f. omphale, has heavy, zebra-striped series of black forewing basal and hind wing costal and postdiscal bands. Underside hind wing white, with orange marks speckled with black, and dark postdiscal band parallel to costa, corresponding with that of upperside. (A) Male upperside. (B) Male underside. (B) Female upperside.
 
There is an intermediate form with reduced black bands, which flies in autumn: f. omphalioides resembles f. omphale, but the hind wing upperside horizontal band is reduced or absent and the underside hind wing base colour is pale pink, heavily irrorated with black scales. (C) Male upperside. (D) Male underside.
 
In the western areas, the 'summer form' resembles the 'winter form' of the eastern areas: f. namaqua lacks the upperside black bands, but has a pale pink to buff underside, with little or no black irroration. (E) Male upperside. (F) Male underside. (G) Female upperside.
 
The normal dry season f. theogone has a similar upperside to Red Tip C. antevippe gavisa f. zera but the change in thickness of the basal black edge of the forewing upperside tip sets it apart. Dark pink hind wing underside is heavily speckled with black. (F) Male upperside. (G) Female upperside. (H) Female underside.

Hind wing underside has cryptic pattern of basal, postdiscal and marginal bands of darker scaling on a grey-brown ground; depth of colour varies between subspecies.
 
Slight sexual dimorphism. Male smaller than female. Male upperside buff with grey-brown margins and rows of black spots; forewing carries prominent sex brand, coloured dark brown to grey-brown in basal part of CuA1 and CuA2, spreading along veins M3, CuA1 and CuA2. Female usually brighter buff than male, with rounded not pointed wings. T. p. aridus is paler than nominate with more extensive upperside buff; desert form f. mijburghi is very pale buff with black spots restricted to cells in female; male also has faint black apical spots. Amount of white in cilia varies.
 
3 subspp., geographically distinct; varying in size and colour.
 
id.
 
T. protumnus lives in discrete colonies in flat country and on hillsides. These probably coincide with colonies of the host ant, a Pugnacious Ant, Anaplolepis sp. Flight is low and fluttering but can be fast and sustained. Males are territorial and congregate around patches of bare gravelly or sandy soil; females fly around inspecting plants for the presence of their host ants. Should she find this she will lay one or two eggs.

Back to Top
Identification
The most widespread Diadem in Africa. A large, conspicuous Nymphaline, the male is unmistakable with his jet-black upperside with iridescent violet-blue ringed white discal blotches.
 
Sexually dimorphic. Females are orange-tawny with black margins and markings similar to those of various forms of the African Monarch, Danaus chrysippus. She is easy to tell apart on close inspection; her build is more robust; her antennae are carried more stiffly and are straight, not angled downwards. And the wings' outer margins are scalloped, not smooth as in D. chrysippus.
 
There is more than one female form, mimicking the three D. chrysippus subspecies found in South Africa, and ones found elsewhere. Form misippus resembles D. chrysippus orientis. F. alcippoides resembles D. chrysippus alcippus. F. inaria resembles D. chrysippus dorippus, and f. dorippoides resembles D. chrysippus dorippus but has the white hind wing patch of D. chrysippus alcippus.

Very small pied Skipper with black-and-white chequered upperside and forewing underside. One of a group of very similar little butterflies, which are difficult to tell apart from the upperside markings. To be reasonably sure of identification a clear view of the hind wing underside is necessary. Similar to Star Sandman Spialia asterodia, but upperside and underside more heavily marked with white. Irregular hind wing underside white median band, unlike Star Sandman, does not run parallel to basal spots. Hind wing underside median band connected to large submarginal spot by thin white line in cell, similar to the much smaller Mite Sandman S. paula. Cilia chequered.
 
Nominate subspecies S. agylla agylla has restricted pale upper and underside markings; hind wing underside essentially brown with white bands and spots. Sexes similar; females usually larger than males, with larger abdomen.

Identification
One of a large group of Chrysoritis Opals with blue wing bases and a shimmering, electric opalescent sheen over a varying area of the wings. For Chrysoritis thysbe, amount of blue on upperside varies, in some subspecies almost covering the forewing. Forewing underside has typical 'Copper' pattern of black spots on a pale ground with dark borders. Hind wing underside varies from plain sandy tan to dark brown, to variegated with striae in various shades of reddish-brown, with bands of paler colouring and brassy postdiscal streaks. 'Plain' underside specimens usually have unicoloured cilia; 'variegated' ones dark cilia with pale interneural flecks, appearing 'chequered'.
 
C. t. mithras has upperside solid blue darker than in C. thysbe thysbe or C. thysbe whitei and seldom extends beyond the forewing cell spot. Cilia orange with small pale interneural spots and black vein ends. Hind wing underside is variegated in dark brown and cream, with silvery white streaks. Sexes differ. Female has rounder wings, upperside blue restricted to basal 25% of wings, no opalescent sheen. The females of the various races are almost impossible to separate on wing patterns and identification usually requires comparison with males seen at the same locality.
 
7 subspp., not always geographically distinct. Rapid, sustained flight, settling on prominent bushes or rocks. Male intensively territorial on hill tops or sand dunes, regularly patrolling and chasing intruders; Females are found more at random, often on flowers.

More dainty than other Trimenia species. The wings are less acutely pointed, especially in the male; there is less difference between the sexes. The typical Trimenia upperside pattern of more or less bright fulvous-orange on the upperside with dark borders, and black-and-white chequered cilia, is continued in this species. The undersides are slightly different, in that the hind wing silvery marks are cursive as in Wallengren's Silver-spotted Copper, but form a more coherent pattern with a large '3' or 'W' shaped postdiscal line and a central roughly triangular blotch. There are two underside colour morphs, brown-and-tan, and wine-red.
 
T. malagrida cedrusmontana: has no dark veining and the dark upperside margins are extensive and well-defined; the orange is a deep red shade. Sexes very similar, females generally larger, paler orange, heavier bodied.
 
4 subspp., geographically distinct, all rare. Found in small, discrete colonies; flight rapid but not sustained; males select a prominent perch on a low plant or rock and chase away intruders. Females are found more at random, often on flowers.

Identification
Small charcoal-grey butterfly with a hint of brown. Compared to Knysna Skolly Thestor brachycera, larger (largest of group) with darker upperside, more conspicuous white cilia chequered with black at the vein ends. Underside forewing discal band lacks prominent break at M2. Upperside darker than Claassens' Skolly T. claassensi, lacking the prominent golden brown markings of that species. Underside of both sexes cryptic, forewing carries prominent submarginal sagittate marks.
 
Sexually dimorphic; male has more distinct whitish streaks distal to forewing upperside cell. Has pale grey-brown tridentate sex brand, restricted to origin of veins M3, CuA1 and CuA2. Female is plainer and more uniformly dark than that of T. brachycera. Underside more brown than that of the male.
 
T. overbergensis lives in colonies on limestone ridges in fynbos. Fast, low flight, settling on rocks or low plants. Males form territories in open areas. Usually found in groups of three or four, but in the right conditions can occur in large numbers.

Identification
Large, dark Charaxes. In certain parts of its range, males can be confused with
Blue-Spotted Charaxes, Charaxes cithaeron cithaeron. However, that species
has much broader hind wing upperside pale patch, almost totally white. The
postdiscal series of forewing royal blue marks are smaller in C. xiphares.
Females are distinctive. C. x. staudei male smaller than C. x. bavenda with
shorter tails, forewing upperside postdiscal spots larger. Forewing underside pale
discal marks larger than in C. x. bavenda. Hind wing underside markings
generally more reduced and obscured than in C. x. bavenda; basal black lines
usually absent. Female smaller than C. x. bavenda with larger forewing
upperside discal spots, particularly that in area CuA1 which is greatly elongated. The hind wing discal patch is generally smaller than in C. x. bavenda. There are three female forms. Nominate upperside has white forewing discal spots and hind wing discal patch white suffused with lavender. In f. arikae the hind wing discal patch is with yellow, and in louisae the hind wing patch is blue.
 
Sexes strongly dimorphic, male with royal blue spots and bands on metallic navy ground, female with white discal forewing band (of variable width) sometimes invaded by yellow-ochre. Most females have a pale yellow hind wing upperside patch, but in some populations, it is blue-white or pale mauve. Differences between females is usually of more value than subtle differences between the males in distinguishing subspecies.
 
Powerful, high flight in the canopy and around tree tops. Males territorial, perching high up and pursuing any butterfly (or other flying creature) that ventures nearby. Females fly rapidly along the fringes of forests where they settle on tree leaves.
 
Both sexes are attracted to rotting fruit, animal dung and sap leaking from wounded trees.

Medium–large white and orange Pierid. As common name implies, wing edges have black spots at the end of veins - variable in appearance, less prominent in dry season specimens. Can be told apart from other Mylothris Dotted Borders by the orange basal forewing flush on both surfaces of both sexes' forewings. Certain female forms of False Dotted Border Belenois thysa also have basal forewing upperside colour flush, but they can immediately be told apart by the double row of hind wing black spots on upper and undersides. Other white Pierids with white wings carrying a basal orange flush are certain female forms of Large Vagrant N. argia, but those are much larger and have more extensive dark marginal marks.
 
Sexually dimorphic, female upperside orange is paler and of a more yellow hue than the male, and covering at least the basal half of both wings, not just the basal third of the forewing.
 
Slow, fluttering flight, often high in forest canopy near host plants; both sexes fond of flowers; may also be found low down along forest paths and rides.

Male upperside buff with grey-brown margins and rows of black spots; forewing carries prominent sex brand, coloured dark brown to grey-brown in basal part of CuA1 and CuA2, spreading along veins M3, CuA1 and CuA2. Female usually brighter buff than male, with rounded not pointed wings. Nominate subspecies Thestor protumnus protumnus is the darkest and has the heaviest upperside spotting, and the most prominently white chequered cilia. Occasional males have very dark buff colouring.
 
3 subspp., geographically distinct; varying in size and colour.
 
T. protumnus lives in discrete colonies in flat country and on hillsides. These probably coincide with colonies of the host ant, a Pugnacious Ant, Anaplolepis sp. Flight is low and fluttering but can be fast and sustained. Males are territorial and congregate around patches of bare gravelly or sandy soil; females fly around inspecting plants for the presence of their host ants. Should she find this she will lay one or two eggs.

Identification
Medium sized white Pierid with coloured or black forewing tips. Very similar to Coast Purple Tip Colotis erone. Male upperside always white; black forewing apical tip with four not three, discrete metallic purple cells; has dusting of grey scales in black margin. Some specimens have a tiny extra spot of purple on costal edge of tip. Shade of purple shiny and iridescent, but not to the same extent as Queen Purple Tip C. regina. That butterfly has a distinct two-tone purple-green 'flop' in the wing tip. Underside varies from pinkish white in all dry season forms but greyer and dingier than Coast Purple Tip; white through cream to yellow in wet season forms; distinctive dark markings remain the same.
 
Sexually dimorphic; males always have a purple upperside forewing tip; females
have several colour morphs - orange-tipped, black-tipped and some have brown or cream patches in the black. They generally have five to six spots in the wing tip, compared to three to four in female f. erone.
 
Fast, erratic flight, settling seldom except to feed at flowers. In cloudy weather may stop to bask in sunny patches. Females are less often seen than males because they are more retiring, but also often come to flowers.
 
Seasonally polymorphic. Male nominotypical wet season f. ione, found mainly in KwaZulu-Natal, has extensive black veins on hind wing upperside and on edge of forewing upperside tip, and underside has heavy black veining on white or cream ground colour, with a dark band crossing the hind wing postdiscal area. (A) Male upperside. (B) Male underside.
 
Wet season male in the rest of Southern Africa is f. phlegyas, which has reduced black veining in the forewing and faint or absent black underside veining on white or cream ground colour. (C) Male upperside. (D) Male underside.
 
There are several wet season female forms. F. ione has orange forewing tips outlined in black, with some red at the basal edge, and heavy black upperside marginal borders, a dark band along the forewing inner margin, dark wing bases, and a dark line crossing the postdiscal area of the hind wing. Underside marked with yellow and buff and has dark marks corresponding to those on upperside. (E) Female upperside. (F) Female underside.
 
Female f. xanthosana resembles f. ione but all white areas are replaced by bright yellow. This form is very rare in South Africa. (G) Female upperside. (H) Female underside.

Female form pepita resembles f. woodi but has the white replaced by yellow as in f. xanthosana. (K) Female upperside. (L) Female underside.
 
Dry season male f. jalone has extensive grey scaling in black border to forewing upperside tip: almost no black veins in forewing upperside white area, and reduced hind wing upperside black veins. Underside hind wing ground colour pink, irrorated with darker brown striae, and crossed by a brown postdiscal stripe. (M) Male upperside. (N) Male underside.
 
There are several dry season female forms. F. jalone has orange forewing tips edged in brown, with other dark markings restricted or absent.

Wing markings white in f. expansa, dark orange in f. heliogenes.
 
Sexes alike, female with markings identical to male, but with rounder wings.
 
Floating, sailing flight, wings open flat, with infrequent rapid wingbeats. This distinguishes them from the more fluttering flight of the models. If disturbed they can put on a turn of speed. Male territorial, perching on prominent forest-edge leaves, chasing intruders. If chased away he usually returns to the same perch. The female is less active. Both sexes are often seen nectaring on flowering trees. Occasionally found low down, drinking at mud puddles.

Identification
Similar in wing shape and habits to Vàri's Brown P. vàrii, but only two ocelli in anal angle of hind wing underside. Populations vary in amount of dark marking on hind wing underside; some have a dark transverse band and submarginal line but never as heavy as in P. vàrii. This butterfly was described from a wetland surrounded by forest at about 1500m altitude near Houtbosdorp in Limpopo. That population appears to have died out, but similar butterflies have been found in high altitude marshes over a wide range of country to the south. These fly at altitudes from just over 2000m on Long Tom Pass in Mpumalanga to over 2300m atop Platberg near Harrismith in the Free State. Opinions vary as to whether these are true P. swanepoel, a subspecies of it, or a hitherto undescribed new species. The photographs shown here are from these populations.

Back to Top
Identification
Small white Pierid with bright orange or dark brown or black wing tips. All forms of male have black edge of forewing upperside apical tip only reaching one-third of the way from margin to costa. Where this ends, in M3, it bends towards apex, forming an elbow penetrating the orange.
 
Sexually dimorphic. Male upperside always has bright orange forewing tip; dark markings range from almost none in extreme dry season forms, to a heavy black 'moustache' mark running along inner margin of forewing and costal margin of hind wing, and a broad black hind wing marginal border. Very many female forms; upperside of many resembles female Bushveld Orange Tip, upperside varying from full 'moustache' to dark wing bases only; forewing apical patch dark markings varying in extent; tip colour varies from bright orange to buff and pale yellow; ground colour from white to pale yellow.
 
Relatively weak, low flight. Both sexes fly at random, often seen on flowers.
 
Seasonally polymorphic. There are many forms, particularly of the female, varying according to the seasons. There are many intermediates and the forms shown here only approximate the 'type' for each; the variation is gradual and no two individuals are exactly alike.
 
All wet season forms' undersides have white to yellow ground colour, more or less extensively marked with black and orange. The male of the extreme wet season form, emini, has the upperside 'moustache' mark extended to reach the outer margin; hind wing dark margin carries no pale blotches. The female is similar but the upperside dark areas are even more extensive, to the point where the white markings may be reduced to reduced to small streaks and blotches. (A) Male upperside. (B) Male underside. (C) Female underside.
 
A commoner wet season form is the less heavily marked f. phlegetonia. The dark markings are similar but the upperside 'moustache' mark does not reach the outer margin; hind wing dark margin has row of submarginal pale blotches. The female sometimes has extensive orange tips. (D) Male upperside. (E) Male underside. (F) Female upperside. (G) Female underside.
 
There is a transitional form, galathinus. The upperside is similar to the wet
season forms, with the 'moustache' mark faint but visible, with some features of
the dry season forms - the female upperside sometimes has a yellow ground
colour, and has a squared-off hind wing dark postdiscal band, angled outwards at the cell. The underside hind wing of both sexes has a pink to buff ground colour, irrorated with grey scales, which is typical of the dry season forms. (H) Male upperside. (I) Male underside. (J) Female upperside.
 
The normal dry season form is delphine; the male totally lacks a 'moustache' mark and the hind wing upperside margin is white with a row of interneural black spots. The female is one of a range of dry season forms; the upperside has a pale orange forewing tip and carries a faint 'moustache' mark; has a faint dark hind wing dark postdiscal band. The underside hind wing of both sexes has a pink to buff ground colour, irrorated with grey scales. (K) Male upperside. (L) Male underside. (M) Female upperside. (N) Mating pair undersides, female to R.
 
Female form pseudetrida resembles f. delphine but has orange-yellow cells in the upperside forewing tip; the upperside ground colour is pale yellow. The underside is the same as other dry season forms. (O) Female upperside. (P) Female underside.
 
In female form wa the dark markings are much reduced, with the forewing upperside dark tip carrying a row of pale yellow streaks. Ground colour is cream to pale yellow. The underside is the same as other dry season forms. (Q) Female upperside.
 
In female form xanthotes the dark markings are restricted to the margin, with the forewing upperside tip reduced to a row of pale yellow streaks with a dark basal stripe. Ground colour is pale yellow. The underside is the same as other dry season forms. (R) Female upperside. (S) Female underside.

Identification
Small, brightly coloured Opal. Markings similar to Common Opal Chrysoritis thysbe bamptoni, with which it flies. It is very similar to that butterfly, and the main difference is the extent of the 'solid' (as opposed to opalescent) forewing upperside blue. It covers the greater part of the wing, penetrating the apex with 'fingers' of blue iridescence penetrating between the apical spots. Forewing underside has typical 'Copper' pattern of black spots on a pale ground with dark borders. Underside hind wing variegated, less variably so than Pan Opal, with bands of deep, rich brown.
 
Sexes differ. Female has reduced upperside basal blue, and more widely spaced black spots than male.
 
Found in colonies on flat sandy ground between inland sand dunes. Males perch on a prominent bush, and fly off rapidly to chase any intruders. Females are more sedentary. Both sexes are often found on flowers. By comparison, Common Opal Chrysoritis thysbe bamptoni occupies the slopes and ridges of the dunes, where Lyndsey's Opal may venture - the two can be found flying together.

More dainty than other Trimenia species. The wings are less acutely pointed, especially in the male; there is less difference between the sexes. The typical Trimenia upperside pattern of more or less bright fulvous-orange on the upperside with dark borders, and black-and-white chequered cilia, is continued in this species. The undersides are slightly different, in that the hind wing silvery marks are cursive as in Wallengren's Silver-spotted Copper, but form a more coherent pattern with a large '3' or 'W' shaped postdiscal line and a central roughly triangular blotch. There are two underside colour morphs, brown-and-tan, and wine-red.
 
Nominate Trimenia malagrida malagrida is a dark subspecies with dull red-orange upperside and a tendency for the paler areas to have dark lines along the veins. Sexes very similar, females generally larger, paler orange, heavier bodied.
 
4 subspp., geographically distinct, all rare. Found in small, discrete colonies; flight rapid but not sustained; males select a prominent perch on a low plant or rock and chase away intruders. Females are found more at random, often on flowers.

Medium to large (for a lycaenid), showy sapphire with distinctive pattern of black-and-white postdiscal blotches and basal violaceous blue on the forewing, and streaked pattern of white, violaceous blue and grey-black on the hind wing. The only similar species in South Africa is Dusky Sapphire, S. subinfuscata reynoldsi, but the upperside violaceous blue colouring tends to be lighter. The major difference is on the underside, where the marginal bands and the area basal to the hind wing dark median band are pale grey or white, not dark grey.
 
The sexes are very similar; females tend to have more extensive white in the apical area of the forewing upperside. S. b. henningi is a deeper shade of violaceous blue than the other subspecies with the white in the forewing apical area reduced or absent.
 
3 subspp., geographically distinct. Flight fast, but slower than other sapphires. Males perch alert on or in prominent bushes on low rocky ridges, chasing intruders; female more sedentary, more usually found near host plants.

Identification
One of a large group of Chrysoritis Opals with blue wing bases and a shimmering, electric opalescent sheen over a varying area of the wings. For Chrysoritis thysbe, amount of blue on upperside varies, in some subspecies almost covering the forewing. Forewing underside has typical 'Copper' pattern of black spots on a pale ground with dark borders. Hind wing underside varies from plain sandy tan to dark brown, to variegated with striae in various shades of reddish-brown, with bands of paler colouring and brassy postdiscal streaks. 'Plain' underside specimens usually have unicoloured cilia; 'variegated' ones dark cilia with pale interneural flecks, appearing 'chequered'.
 
Nominate Chrysoritis thysbe thysbe usually has chequered cilia and variegated underside. Sexes differ. Female has rounder wings, upperside blue restricted to basal 25% of wings, no opalescent sheen. The females of the various races are almost impossible to separate on wing patterns and identification usually requires comparison with males seen at the same locality.
 
7 subspp., not always geographically distinct. Rapid, sustained flight, settling on prominent bushes or rocks. Male intensively territorial on hill tops or sand dunes, regularly patrolling and chasing intruders; Females are found more at random, often on flowers.

Underside dove grey fading to white towards the outer margin, with series of prominent white-edged black spots. Both wing surfaces of the hind wing carry a conspicuous marginal black spot in area CuA2, edged basally with an orange lunule. The orange spreads into CuA1 and sometimes M3 and 1A+2A. In this it differs from Tailed Meadow Blue, which has a much more extensive orange patch, spreading across the entire anal margin of the hind wing from 1A+2A to M2 and in some specimens RS.
 
Sexually dimorphic. Male upperside deep clear blue, dark margins narrow, female upperside blue suffused distally with white, marginal borders wide.
 
Fast, erratic flight; can be mistaken for one of the blue Lepidochrysops species. Usually found singly or in small groups in open Grassland. Males patrol hillsides; females are found close to the host plants.

Back to Top
Identification
Large, dark Charaxes. In certain parts of its range, males can be confused with Blue-Spotted Charaxes, Charaxes cithaeron cithaeron. However, that species has much broader hind wing upperside pale patch, almost totally white. The postdiscal series of forewing royal blue marks are smaller in C. xiphares. Females are distinctive. C. x. draconis has short, blunt tails in both sexes and, in the female, even larger upperside pale markings than C. x. penningtoni. Has two female forms, nominate and f. candida, which has a white hind wing upperside discal patch, with a violet sheen at the edges.
 
Sexes strongly dimorphic, male with royal blue spots and bands on metallic navy ground, female with white discal forewing band (of variable width) sometimes invaded by yellow-ochre. Most females have a pale yellow hind wing upperside patch, but in some populations, it is blue-white or pale mauve. Differences between females is usually of more value than subtle differences between the males in distinguishing subspecies.
 
Powerful, high flight in the canopy and around tree tops. Males territorial, perching high up and pursuing any butterfly (or other flying creature) that ventures nearby. Females fly rapidly along the fringes of forests where they settle on tree leaves.
 
Both sexes are attracted to rotting fruit, animal dung and sap leaking from wounded trees.

Identification
Large blue Lepidochrysops Ant Blue. Largest of the Koppie Blue group. Discocellular forewing upperside dark spot usually broader, more prominent. Underside similar to Southern Blue Lepidochrysops australis, but hind wing underside markings more delicately picked out in white. Postdiscal sagittate marks closer to the marginal series of white-ringed dark spots; their points less likely to touch the edges of the discal spots. Cilia bright white with black chequering at the vein ends.
 
Sexes differ in that the female upperside, as in many of the genus Lepidochrysops, has a row of dark postdiscal spots on the forewing, and a dark band crossing the hind wing, corresponding to the dark underside spotting. Male upperside is a less violaceous blue than Southern Blue; female upperside discal blue patches brighter blue, over a darker ground colour. Male upperside has narrower dark borders.
 
Fast, patrolling flight, seldom settling, easily disturbed. May fly in numbers. Male on hill tops and ridges, also rocky ledges between large crags, below main peaks. Female lower down slopes at base of rocky escarpment.

Identification
Medium sized butterfly. Battling Glider is the smaller of South Africa's two Cymothoe species; the other being Blonde Glider Cymothoecoranus. Compared to that species, apart from size, C. alcimeda has more angulate wings and, usually, a more heavily marked underside.
 
C. a. clarki males are less heavily-marked than in C. a. alcimeda, and the population has a greater proportion of orange– and grey-banded females than in C. a. trimeni, which it resembles. Sexually dimorphic: male upperside creamy white; both sexes' underside cryptic.
 
Both sexes have the typical Liminitinae gliding flight with bursts of rapid wingbeats. Males perch high up on forest edge trees and shrubs, and sally forth to chase away all other insects. When there is more than one male in a forest clearing, constant aerial battles take place, hence the common name. Females are found close to the host plants. Both sexes regularly drink at wet mud, and nectar from flowers. They are also attracted to fruit bait.

A smaller Playboy. The only male Virachola Playboy in South Africa that can be confused with Orange-barred Playboy Virachola diocles but the forewing is uniformly dark brown or black, may have a slight patch of paler scales in the discal area, but never a band; also shot with purple when viewed at an acute angle.
 
Underside of both sexes is grey, paler than other Virachola Playboys; male in particular has bright white suffusion on hind wing. Submarginal and postdiscal rows of darker grey and white lines are 'cut' into segments by the wing veins, and there are large, bright red basal hind wing spots. Both sexes have a single white-tipped tail at the hind wing anal angle.
 
Sexes differ on the upperside. The female is blackish-brown with whitish discal patches, never dove-grey or pale-blue as in other Playboy females.
 
Males spend midday whirling around tree tops; seen usually early morning or late afternoon with females on flowers; may perch lower down on hilltops or along paths in low coastal bush.

Medium to large butterfly, with weak but sustained fluttering flight, sometimes sailing, at medium height, 2–3m above the ground. Usually found flying alone or in small groups, but may be found in large numbers on wounded plants exuding pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Fond of nectar. This species has complex biogeography; it is widespread across Asia, southern Europe and the whole of Africa. Several subspecies occur across this range, the relationship between these is the subject of several studies.
 
In SA the commonest form is Danaus chrysippus orientis, which has a white-spotted black forewing tip and a plain orange hind wing. The size of the white forewing tips varies, from small discrete spots to a continuous, jagged edged band.
 
Typical Danaus chrysippus orientis, as found in South Africa, has a tawny orange upperside with black marginal borders containing small white spots. There is a variable degree of darker chocolate-brown basal suffusion.

Identification
Small reddish-coppery Opal. The only Chrysoritis found on KwaZulu-Natal coast. Similar to Burnished Opal Chrysoritis chrysaor, but upperside black spots larger, and more pronounced hind wing anal lobe carries a short tail, and upperside hind wing has a black discocellular bar. Upperside often has a shifting gold-green lustre over the copper. Underside forewing has typical 'Copper' pattern of black spots on a pale ground with dark borders.
 
Sexes similar, female with rounder wings, less brilliant copper, but often has golden flush. Underside hind wing is reddish brown in male; suffused with dull green in female.
 
Found in small colonies, always close to host plant. Flight low and fast but settles often.

Back to Top
Identification
Small white Pierid with bright orange or dark brown or black wing tips. Male upperside resembles small Red Tip Colotis antevippe gavisa; wings more rounded, orange forewing tips duller. Male is easy to distinguish from Small Orange Tip C. evagore antigone by the lack of small black 'elbow' at outer basal edge of tip; basal edge of tip edged with black across wing with no breaks, even in very pale individuals. Forewing of both sexes always has distinct black spot at end of cell. Wet season males have a 'moustache' as in Red Tip; in dry season forms, reduced to basal dark patch or absent.
 
Sexually dimorphic. Female basic pattern is white ground colour with dark upperside wing tip carrying an orange patch variable from absent to large, and a 'moustache' that is heavy in WSFs and weak, but still present, in DSFs. Hind wing has dark marginal and submarginal bands, latter angled outwards at cell. The forewing underside apical patch carries no deep orange areas, but dry season forms may have pale orange suffusion.
 
Seasonally polymorphic. There are a large number of named seasonal forms. There are many intermediates and the forms shown here only approximate the 'type' for each; the variation is gradual and no two individuals are exactly alike. Female WSFs have heavy upperside dark markings and pale underside hind wing, DSFs with lighter upperside markings, pink hind wing underside with black scaling, dark postdiscal spots. These can be told apart from the very similar female DSF Small Orange Tip by the lack of underside forewing orange tip, and the patch distal to the hind wing underside cell, which is paler in C. evagore, but same grey-irrorated pink or buff as rest of hind wing in C. pallene. In many intermediates, forewing upperside apical patch varies from broad orange cells to none at all as in f. absurda.
 
The most heavily marked wet season form is infumatus, with extensive dark markings, a broad hind wing marginal band, and a pale, lightly marked underside. (A) Male upperside. (B) Male underside. Females resemble those of form pallene (F).
 
The normal summer form in KwaZulu-Natal is f. seineri, which is more lightly marked with the hind wing marginal band usually broken into triangular spots. (D) Male upperside. Females resemble those of form pallene (F).
 
Form pallene is the most lightly marked wet season form, which has the black 'moustache' in the male reduced. (D) Male upperside. (E) Male underside. (F) Female upperside.
 
The dry season form most often encountered is f. halyattes, whose male has the dark 'moustache' reduced to a basal patch, and has small hind wing marginal dark spots. The female has similar markings to the wet season forms but they are reduced. Dry season form undersides are extensively speckled with dark grey, often with a pink suffusion. (G) Male upperside. (H) Male underside. (I) Female upperside. (J) Female underside.
 
Extreme dry season form pallida male has dark basal marking much reduced or absent; females still have dark markings but these are much reduced. (K) Male upperside. (L) Male and female undersides (in copula). (M) Male underside. (N) Female upperside.

Large, dark brown Skipper. Distinguished by its white hind wing underside band, with three black spots at the anal angle, and tapers strongly towards the costa, which it touches. Otherwise it is very similar to Striped Policeman Coeliades forestan; black-brown upperside with yellow-ochre basal suffusion. It also resembles the larger, much rarer (in South Africa) One-pip Policeman, Pyrrhiades anchises. That species is battleship grey, not brown, has only one hind wing underside black spot at the anal angle, and the white band does not reach the costa.
 
Sexes similar; females usually larger and paler than males.
 
Males show very territorial behaviour; they choose a prominent twig or leaf in the territory. On this they perch and make circular sorties around their territory, a 'beat' from which the common name derives. Females are more sedentary and are usually found near the host plants.

Identification
Medium sized canopy butterfly, dark with paler bands. In flight, almost impossible to distinguish from Common Wanderer Acraea aganice aganice, but antennae longer and carried more stiffly, and has black spots on both surfaces of forewing cell, lacking on Common Wanderer forewing.
 
Sexes similar. Male has narrower, more angular wings, and pale bands are pale buff in common eurytus, orange in very rare f. pondo. Females have longer, broader wings and the pale bands are white in the commoner f. chionea; the rarer f. eurytus has bands the same pale buff colour as the male.
 
Floating, sailing flight, wings open flat, with infrequent rapid wingbeats. The model also has a floating flight, but appears weaker and the wingbeats are slower. If disturbed they can put on a turn of speed. Male territorial, perching on prominent forest-edge leaves, chasing intruders. If chased away he usually returns to the same perch. The female is less active. They are not as often seen nectaring as the other local Pseudacraea species. Occasionally found low down, drinking at mud puddles.

The forewing discal band of spots varies in shape and width between the subspecies.
 
The nominate subspecies is not found in South Africa. P. ophidicephalus phalusco is the most widespread local subspecies. It has been quoted as the largest, although big females of P. ophidicephalus zuluensis may be larger. The forewing discal band of yellow spots is nearly straight; widens towards the apex. In males the spots in areas R3 to M2 are usually joined; in females the spots may be joined as far down the wing as CuA1. Sexes similar; male has bands of shiny scent scales on forewing between postdiscal and submarginal yellow spots. Females have varying degrees of irroration with yellow scales in these areas.
 
5 subspp., geographically distinct. Flies fast with powerful wingbeats; may stoop low

Small buff butterfly. One of the more handsome Skollies; male is the darkest of the Compassberg Skolly group, with the least elongated forewings. Underside hind wing pale grey to brown with indistinct basal band and faint submarginal row of 'V' shaped marks joined into a line. Has a dark, zigzag median line bent towards the margin between veins M1 and M3.
 
Sexually dimorphic. Male has golden-buff wing bases and heavy black wing tips; usual discal spotting merged into wingtip; tridentate sex brand is also golden-buff; restricted to veins M3, CuA1 and CuA2. Underside hind wing pale grey with well-defined median line. Female is a more typical buff Thestor type, with more pale colouring on wings. Dark bands heavy; shade of buff varies from dull buff to bright orange-buff. Underside hind wing pale brown with fainter median line than male; cf. Female T. compassbergae and T. pringlei.
 
T. kaplani lives in colonies, usually on high, north-east facing mountain slopes, between large rocks and on ridges. Fast, low flight, settling on rocks or low plants. Males form territories in areas of gravel. Difficult to follow in flight; when settled, superbly camouflaged underside hard to spot. Usually found in groups of three or four, but in the right conditions can occur in large numbers.

More dainty than other Trimenia species. The wings are less acutely pointed, especially in the male; there is less difference between the sexes. The typical Trimenia upperside pattern of more or less bright fulvous-orange on the upperside with dark borders, and black-and-white chequered cilia, is continued in this species. The undersides are slightly different, in that the hind wing silvery marks are cursive as in Wallengren's Silver-spotted Copper, but form a more coherent pattern with a large '3' or 'W' shaped postdiscal line and a central roughly triangular blotch. There are two underside colour morphs, brown-and-tan, and wine-red.
 
T. malagrida maryae: largest subspecies with most extensive ochreous orange on upperside; black distal borders narrower than the other subspecies. Sexes very similar, females generally larger, paler orange, heavier bodied.
 
4 subspp., geographically distinct, all rare. Found in small, discrete colonies; flight rapid but not sustained; males select a prominent perch on a low plant or rock and chase away intruders. Females are found more at random, often on flowers.

Both surfaces of both sexes' hind wings have prominent orange lunules above large black spots at the anal angle. The largest spot is in area CuA1. Hind wing carries a small tail at end of vein CuA2. Cilia plain whitish grey.
 
Sexually dimorphic; male upperside is plain brownish-grey, with the underside spotting showing through, giving the appearance of being semi-translucent. Female upperside violaceous-blue, resembling that of Patrician Blue.
 
Fast, erratic flight. Males patrol high points in veld, circling around and settling on grass stems and low bushes, usually the same one each time. They also sometimes adopt territories in flat ground, using a prominent bush or tree as a perch. Females fly more at random, often found on flowers or close to the host plant.

Identification
Small black-and-orange/red butterflies; uppersides are black with varying degrees of red/orange spots and blotches. Undersides are beautifully camouflaged against their habitat; intricate patterns of black or dark grey on a white or pale grey ground, with submarginal spots in varying shades of red to orange, yellow or white. There are some similar species to Amakosa Rocksitter; Natal Rocksitter Durbania limbata upperside has outer half of hind wing broad red; sexes similar and flies in late summer to autumn, not spring and early summer. And Clark's Rocksitter D. clarki is much smaller and its range does not overlap with that of D. amakosa.
 
Sexually dimorphic. D. a. ayresi is similar to D. a. natalensis but the upperside markings are more yellowish and in the male, the orange hind wing spots are fused into a continuous band.
 
7 subspp., geographically distinct.
 
Rocksitters, as their name suggests, like to sit on rocks; they do this for long periods with wings closed, their cryptic undersides hiding them well against lichen growing on the rock. Occasionally one will take off and patrol the area searching for mates. The flight is weak and fluttering, and they have trouble with headwinds, so they keep low, in the boundary layer. They lack a proboscis and cannot feed as adults, so they are never seen on flowers.

Identification
Small Charaxes. Male has shiny black upperside. Forewing margin has bluish-grey sheen and paler interneural smudges at the margin. The male is very similar to Demon Charaxes Charaxes phaeus. It tends to have hind wing underside silvery sheen on costa not spreading beyond the cell. But they are only reliably separable on genitalic dissection. Female resembles C. ethalion ethalion, but smaller, and more extensive silvery blue surrounding hind wing white median band. Forewing white discal spots often suffused with peach-pink. Male territorial on hill tops.
 
Sexually dimorphic, only one female form, unlike C. ethalion ethalion.
 
Although this is a small Charaxes it lacks nothing in speed of flight or, in the male, pugnacity. Males form territories on hilltops, or in flat country, around prominent bushes and trees. They pursue any butterfly (or other flying creature) that ventures nearby. Females are found close to the host plants, or wandering around searching for males. Both sexes are often found drinking on wet mud.
 
Both sexes are attracted to rotting fruit, animal dung and sap leaking from wounded trees.

Large, dark Charaxes. In certain parts of its range, males can be confused with Blue-Spotted Charaxes, Charaxes cithaeron cithaeron. However, that species has much broader hind wing upperside pale patch, almost totally white. The postdiscal series of forewing royal blue marks are smaller in C. xiphares. Females are distinctive. C. x. thyestes, in the male, costal hind wing upperside spots blue, tinged slightly with white; double black spots at tornus of forewing underside fused. Female hind wing upperside yellow patch paler than in nominate.
 
Sexes strongly dimorphic, male with royal blue spots and bands on metallic navy ground, female with white discal forewing band (of variable width) sometimes invaded by yellow-ochre. Most females have a pale yellow hind wing upperside patch, but in some populations, it is blue-white or pale mauve. Differences between females is usually of more value than subtle differences between the males in distinguishing subspecies.
 
Powerful, high flight in the canopy and around tree tops. Males territorial, perching high up and pursuing any butterfly (or other flying creature) that ventures nearby. Females fly rapidly along the fringes of forests where they settle on tree leaves.

Tiny to small buff butterfly. Resembles Lipara Buff Baliochila lipara or Common Buff B. aslanga but both sexes have one dark costal mark just outside the forewing cell. No dark costal marks at the base of the forewing as in Baliochila spp. Hind wing underside has orange-red marks on a brown ground; instead of being lines of prominent discrete spots as in B. aslanga they form bands. These may be indistinct or even absent. There is some seasonal dimorphism; dry season individuals tend to have paler, less well-marked hind wing undersides. Rare Pallid Buff C. pallida is very similar; only reliably distinguished by genitalic dissection, but usually has pale grey irroration on dark forewing tip.
 
Sexes similar.
 
Weak, fluttering flight. Usually flies high in canopy, sometimes many seen flying together. Favours spaces with spindly saplings under large trees on forest edges. Settles on twigs, wings closed; periodically suddenly opening them. When doing this it resembles a tiny yellowed leaf waving in the breeze. Occasionally found roosting communally. Female flies lower, searching for oviposition sites. Often found in groups, imbibing honeydew from scale insects on twigs or leaves.

Cilia plain dark brown. Upperside similar to other Hoppers in the genus Platylesches, but forewing lacks subapical spots along the costa. Underside markings resemble several species of Acraea but the wing shape and body build is unmistakably a Skipper. The only other Skipper to have 'Acraea'-like hind wing underside markings is Spotted Velvet Skipper, Abantis tettensis, but that species' upperside is conspicuously pied in black and white, and does not fly in the same areas.
 
Sexes similar; female larger with stouter abdomen and more rounded wings.
 
Flight fairly slow, skipping, hopping. Shy and wary; if disturbed, flies off rapidly, seldom returning. Male does not hilltop; establishes territories along edges of thick bush and forest, perching high on a prominent twig or leaf, chasing away other butterflies. Fond of flowers.

Small dark butterfly. Very similar to Riley's Skolly Thestor rileyi and Peninsula Skolly T. yildizae, but upperside darker. Underside forewing usually only has a single mid-cell spot; sub-basal spot absent. Discal band broader than in T. Yildizae and evenly oblique, with no pronounced break at area M2.
 
Sexes similar. Male darker, with squarer wings than female. Forewing tridentate sex brand is large and dark grey-brown so that it is difficult to pick up against the ground colour; covering basal part of CuA1 and CuA2, spreading along veins M3, CuA1 and CuA2.
 
2 subspp., geographically distinct.
 
T. petra occupies large areas of hillsides at high altitude. Sometimes found in vast numbers. Flight weak, easy to follow, settling often on the ground or on low plants.

Back to Top
Identification
Large, dark Charaxes. In certain parts of its range, males can be confused with Blue-Spotted Charaxes, Charaxes cithaeron cithaeron. However, that species has much broader hind wing upperside pale patch, almost totally white. The postdiscal series of forewing royal blue marks are smaller in C. xiphares. Females are distinctive. C. x. occidentalis has reduced upperside discal blue in the male; hind wing marginal lunules shorter and thicker. Female upperside hind wing discal patch narrower, paler.
 
Sexes strongly dimorphic, male with royal blue spots and bands on metallic navy ground, female with white discal forewing band (of variable width) sometimes invaded by yellow-ochre. Most females have a pale yellow hind wing upperside patch, but in some populations, it is blue-white or pale mauve. Differences between females is usually of more value than subtle differences between the males in distinguishing subspecies.
 
Powerful, high flight in the canopy and around tree tops. Males territorial, perching high up and pursuing any butterfly (or other flying creature) that ventures nearby. Females fly rapidly along the fringes of forests where they settle on tree leaves.
 
Both sexes are attracted to rotting fruit, animal dung and sap leaking from wounded trees.

Identification
Medium-sized white butterfly. forewing upperside pattern similar to other Belenois species such as Brown-veined White B. aurota, and African Veined White B. gidica that have dumb-bell shaped bars at the distal end of the cell. It can be distinguished by the shiny, pearlescent white upperside and thin, dark lines along hind wing underside wing veins.
 
There is considerable seasonal and geographical variation. Males are fairly constant in
upperside colour and markings, but on the underside the forewing apex and hind wing
ground colour can vary from pale cream to yellow, or grey-white. Females vary from
the nominate form zochalia, which resembles the male, to the yellow hind wing form
hyoma. The rare form agrippinides has a creamy yellow forewing and deep
yellow hind wing (not illustrated). In Gauteng and NW Province the dry season forms approach f. immaculata; females never have yellow hind wings. The underside markings are reduced or absent in these butterflies.
 
Flight fluttering, not usually sustained, along forest edges. Both sexes are often seen nectaring at flowers. In hot weather they may drink from mud puddles.

Identification
Medium sized butterfly. It has two seasonal forms, which are different in appearance. Wet season (summer) form is deep orange with black bands and rows of spots, similar in appearance to Gaudy Commodore Precis octavia sesamus but smaller, of a  less pink hue, and with more extensive dark markings on both wing surfaces. Dry season (winter) form has a leaf-like wing shape. Upperside similar to summer form but darker; underside similar to Dry-leaf Commodore P. tugela tugela or Soldier Pansy Junonia terea elgiva, but uppersides very different and not found in same habitat. Could be confused on the wing with Pirate Catacroptera cloanthe or one of the Jokers, Byblia spp. It lacks the plain underside of the former and the pale bands and spots of the latter, which are smaller butterflies.
 
Sexes similar within the forms; females slightly larger.
 
Flies at low height to a metre or two above the ground, in grassy Savanna and woodland. Short glides interspersed with bursts of rapid wingbeats. Flies away rapidly if disturbed; males strongly territorial, sitting on prominent point, chasing away intruders. and if chased away, usually returning to where first seen.
 
Wet season form f. simia deep bright orange with dark wing bases, marginal bands and complete submarginal row of black spots. Underside similarly marked to upperside. Dry season form f. antilope similar upperside markings to f. simia but ground colour duller, darker. Underside is a convincing dead leaf mimic, varying greatly in colour from red-brown to black and greenish buff.

More dainty than other Trimenia species. The wings are less acutely pointed, especially in the male; there is less difference between the sexes. The typical Trimenia upperside pattern of more or less bright fulvous-orange on the upperside with dark borders, and black-and-white chequered cilia, is continued in this species. The undersides are slightly different, in that the hind wing silvery marks are cursive as in Wallengren's Silver-spotted Copper, but form a more coherent pattern with a large '3' or 'W' shaped postdiscal line and a central roughly triangular blotch. There are two underside colour morphs, brown-and-tan, and wine-red.
 
T. malagrida paarlensis: has no dark veining and the ochreous orange on the upperside is paler and more extensive than the nominate subspecies. Sexes very similar, females generally larger, paler orange, heavier bodied.
 
4 subspp., geographically distinct, all rare. Found in small, discrete colonies; flight rapid but not sustained; males select a prominent perch on a low plant or rock and chase away intruders. Females are found more at random, often on flowers.

Back to Top
Identification
Very small pied Skipper with black-and-white chequered upperside and forewing underside. One of a group of very similar little butterflies, which are difficult to tell apart from the upperside markings. To be reasonably sure of identification a clear view of the hind wing underside is necessary. Similar to Star Sandman S. asterodia, but upperside and underside more heavily marked with white. Irregular hind wing underside white median band, unlike Star Sandman, does not run parallel to basal spots. Hind wing underside median band connected to large submarginal spot by thin white line in cell, similar to the much smaller Mite Sandman S. paula. Cilia chequered.
 
S. agylla bamptoni has more extensive white markings, particularly on the underside hind wing which is essentially white with bands of brown spots. Sexes similar; females usually larger than males, with larger abdomen.
 
2 subspp., geographically distinct. Fast, buzzing, low flight, settling often, wings open. Male more often on ledges and ridges than hill tops, female near host plants. Both sexes fond of flowers, particularly Mesembryanthemum vygies.

Medium-sized, Skipper with distinctive black-veined ochre-yellow upperside. The only species with which it might be confused is Bicolored Skipper, Abantis bicolor, which is brighter yellow with black, not hyaline forewing spots and lacks the hind wing underside white patch.
 
Sexes similar; females usually larger and paler than males, with more elongated wings.
 
Males show strong territorial behaviour; they choose a prominent twig or leaf, usually on a hilltop shrub or tree. On this they perch and on occasion fly rapidly around their territory, with buzzing wings a blur. Other butterflies are attacked with vigour. Females are more sedentary and are usually found near the host plants. Both sexes perch wings-open.

Identification
Distinctive medium sized grey butterfly with tiny white spots edged with black. Its colouring resembles the Guinea Fowl, hence its common name. Well-worn specimens may appear dull and unattractive, but freshly emerged butterflies are striking. The only species that could be confused with it (habits are similar) is Mottled-green Nymph, Euryphura achlys, but that butterfly is much rarer and has a metallic green upperside with a pattern of regular, black blotches. Some seasonal variation. Wet season form f. meleagris has prominent pattern of underside white spots mirroring upperside black spots.
 
Sexes similar, female larger, with wings more rounded.
 
Low, fast, gliding flight a few centimetres above the ground, wings open with occasional rapid wingbeats. Usually seen on bushveld paths and bare ground. Flies off rapidly to avoid pursuit. They settle readily, wings-open but are very wary and difficult to approach. Attracted to fallen fruit and animal faeces, and wet mud. They come to fruit baited traps.

Large, bright blue Lepidochrysops Ant Blue. One of the most brilliantly coloured members of the genus; similar to Patrician Blue Lepidochrysops patricia but deeper, richer blue and underside of both sexes boldly patterned, dove grey ground with white rings around very large darker brown-grey markings. Also resembles (and used to be confused with) Trimen's Blue L. trimeni; that species' upperside is deeper, duller blue and the underside ground colour much darker, almost black, with dark spots thinly ringed with white. Both surfaces of both sexes' hind wings have a single prominent orange lunule above a large black spot at the anal angle in area CuA1. Hind wing carries a small tail at end of vein CuA2. Cilia plain whitish grey.
 
Sexually dimorphic; female upperside resembles female Patrician Blue in having blue discal and basal areas inside wide dark fuscous-grey margins, but blue is brighter, deeper. Male upperside is iridescent azure with a fine black marginal line.
 
Males - often a dozen or more - ascend hills at midday but seldom to summits, circling prominent trees or rocks, or flying along contours. Also found in flat country near prominent trees and shrubs. Flight rapid, jinking and erratic. They settle occasionally on low vegetation where they can be approached with stealth. Female flight more random; usually found on flowers.

One of the larger sapphires; upperside intense metallic blue with black margins and shiny white underside. Underside hind wing crossed by submarginal thin jagged black line, not red as in Southern Sapphire Iolaus silas or Straight-line Sapphire I. silarus silarus. Upperside black margins narrower than in I. silas, particularly on the hind wing; similar in this respect to I. silarus silarus. Forewing tips more pointed (in both sexes) than either I. silas or I. silarus silarus. In males, the upperside red hind wing anal lunules that are conspicuous in I. silas are reduced or absent.
 
Sexes differ slightly; female duller blue than male, hind wing upperside marginal band narrow; red only at anal angle, black-edged blue as far as M1, compared to very broad and red to M1 in I. silas. Distal part of forewing upperside blue patch suffused with white to lesser degree than in I. silas, sometimes absent. Male has conspicuous sex brand at hind wing upperside costa.
 
Males perch atop hilltop shrubs and trees during midday hours, preferring those with glossy leaves against which their white underside is not easy to spot. But the white and blue combination is conspicuous in flight. Females are found closer to host plant, and nectaring at low flowers.

Very easy to mistake for an Iolaus sapphire, with bright white underside crossed
by straight dark lines. But lines thinner than in any sapphire, and underside
brighter than Azure Hairstreak Hemiolaus caeculus or Purple-brown and Coastal
Hairstreaks H. philippus, H. lochmophila. The lines crossing the underside are blackish-brown, not orange or pale brown. The hind wing tails are much longer, in proportion to the wing, than any Iolaus, Hemiolaus, or Hypolycaena species found in South Africa. They approach the tail length found in tropical Hairstreaks. Bright white underside of both sexes conspicuous in flight.
 
The sexes are very dimorphic. Male upperside iridescent steel blue, as opposed to the sapphire or powder blue of an Iolaus. Female has conspicuous upperside white discal bands on grey-black ground.
 
Fairly slow flight along forest edge, settling frequently on shrubs. Males defend small territories near prominent leaves and twigs. Females fly low among the vegetation, feeding on flowers.

Identification
Tiny dark Skipper with black-and-white chequered upperside and forewing underside. One of a group of very similar little butterflies, which are difficult to tell apart from the upperside markings. To be reasonably sure of identification a clear view of the hind wing underside is necessary. Hind wing underside has pearly white median band made up of joined spots. That in the cell and submarginal spot in area M2 are joined by a dark edged thin silvery line. In this respect resembles Star Sandman S. asterodia and Grassveld Sandman S. agylla but those are larger and the hind wing marks are plain white, not pearly. Cilia chequered.
 
Sexes similar; females usually larger than males, with larger abdomen.
 
Fast, buzzing, low flight, settling often, wings open. Male hilltops, but usually not at main summit. Also in flat country. Favours patches of stony ground among low vegetation. Male circles these areas with low, rapid flight, fast wingbeats. Female sometimes near the males, more usually looking for host plants. Both sexes feed on flowers.

Medium sized butterfly. Battling Glider is the smaller of South Africa's two Cymothoe species; the other being Blonde Glider Cymothoecoranus coranus. Compared to that species, apart from size, C. alcimeda has more angulate wings and, usually, a more heavily marked underside.
 
C. a. marieps male has a distinct, dark trilobed mark in the middle of the forewing upperside cell. Two female forms named. Sexually dimorphic: male upperside creamy white; both sexes' underside cryptic.
 
Both sexes have the typical Liminitinae gliding flight with bursts of rapid wingbeats. Males perch high up on forest edge trees and shrubs, and sally forth to chase away all other insects. When there is more than one male in a forest clearing, constant aerial battles take place, hence the common name. Females are found close to the host plants. Both sexes regularly drink at wet mud, and nectar from flowers. They are also attracted to fruit bait.

But that butterfly lacks the broad dark margins and has a single forewing discal spot, not a band.
 
Sexes similar. Females larger than males.
 
Weak, fluttering flight. Flies slowly in the shade of trees in the forest understorey, settling on exposed twigs and the ends of tendrils, slowly opening and closing its wings. Often found flying with Zulu Buff Teriomima zuluana and Spotted Buff Pentila tropicalis. When handled, exudes bitter smelling fluid from the thorax, so it is probably a distasteful model, but it is not certain which species of lepidoptera mimic it.

Back to Top
Identification
Medium sized butterfly. Battling Glider is the smaller of South Africa's two Cymothoe species; the other being Blonde Glider Cymothoecoranus coranus. Compared to that species, apart from size, C. alcimeda has more angulate wings and, usually, a more heavily marked underside. C. a. transvaalica male has a series of discrete dark postmedial angular marks on the upperside of both wings. Two female forms named. Male upperside creamy white; both sexes' underside cryptic.
 
Both sexes have the typical Liminitinae gliding flight with bursts of rapid wingbeats. Males perch high up on forest edge trees and shrubs, and sally forth to chase away all other insects. When there is more than one male in a forest clearing, constant aerial battles take place, hence the common name. Females are found close to the host plants. Both sexes regularly drink at wet mud, and nectar from flowers. They are also attracted to fruit bait.

Small bright orange Bitter Acraea. The male is quite distinctive compared to other small butterflies in this genus.

Sexes dimorphic. Male consistently orange, with characteristic spotted black margins, and black blotch at end of forewing cell on upperside. Females are very variable (a range is illustrated), from being similar to the male, to greater or lesser suffusion of black, white, buff and brown, to transparent. The sexes' undersides are similar.

Identification
Very small butterfly with patterns of orange or orange-red and black on the upperside; has a greater or lesser amount of black in the centre of the forewing depending on sex and subspecies. Underside irrorated with black, grey and white with tiny submarginal spots on the hind wing. The other Rocksitters that fly in the same areas are Boland Rocksitter Durbaniopsis saga and two of the races of Amakosa Rocksitter, Durbania amakosa amakosa and D. a. penningtoni. Durbaniella clarki is generally smaller than either, although small males of D. saga can be in the same size range. It can immediately be distinguished from that species by the underside; D. clarki lacks the conspicuous dark and light bands of D. saga. Compared to D. amakosa, the differences are sex-related. Females of D. amakosa are always much larger and have more extensive, better defined patterns of orange or orange-red and black on the upperside. D. a. amakosa males have discrete orange-red spots on the upperside. D. a. penningtoni males have very similar upperside markings to D. clarki but they are more of a yellow-buff colour and the hind wing base is dark, .
 
Variable degree of sexual dimorphism depending on subspecies. Nominate subspecies D. c. clarki upperside colouration varies from light orange to brick red; discal black patch well developed in both sexes but female has a broader postdiscal orange band than the male.
 
4 subspp., geographically distinct; varying in markings and colour.
 
Rocksitters, as their name suggests, like to sit on rocks; they do this for long periods with wings closed, their cryptic undersides hiding them well against lichen growing on the rock. Occasionally one will take off and patrol the area searching for mates. The flight is weak and fluttering, and they have trouble with headwinds, so they keep low, in the boundary layer. They lack a proboscis and cannot feed as adults, so they are never seen on flowers.

Identification
Medium sized butterfly. It has two seasonal forms, which are very different in appearance and habits. Dry season (winter) form has blue upperside and green-black underside. Wet season (summer) form is orange-pink with black bands and rows of spots. Winter form is unique; summer form could be confused on the wing with Pirate Catacroptera cloanthe or one of the Jokers, Byblia spp. It lacks the plain underside of the former and the pale bands and spots of the latter, which are smaller butterflies.
 
Sexes similar within the forms; females slightly larger.
 
Flies at low height to a metre or two above the ground. Short glides interspersed with bursts of rapid wingbeats. Flies away rapidly if disturbed; males strongly territorial, sitting on prominent point, chasing away intruders. and if chased away, usually returning to where first seen. Summer form is a very active butterfly, usually found on open hillsides and summits. Winter form is more skulking, found more often gardens and woods near montane Grassland, or along stream banks. It hibernates in deep gullies and under banks and rocks; roosts gregariously. Several dozen may be disturbed from such secluded shelters. Both forms are often found nectaring on flowers.
 
Wet season form f. natalensis bright orange-red with dark wing bases, marginal bands and complete submarginal row of black spots. Dry season form f. sesamus deep blue with bands of black and paler blue spots; a submarginal row of red spots, and white submarginal spots at the forewing apex. Occasional intermediates occur, which vary greatly in colour, from red and blue, to purple, with varying extent of dark markings.

Tiny to small butterfly. Males have brown-black upperside, female distinctly pied in

scales. Male very similar to that of Common Woolly Legs Lachnocnema bibulus from
which it can only be separated by genitalic dissection. Male has some similarities to D'Urban's Woolly Legs L. durbani but that butterfly is a denizen of Grassland, the upperside is a dull grey-brown and the underside has a regular pattern of buff or pale brown on a grey ground.
 
Sexually dimorphic. Male upperside brown-black, female dark grey with well-defined white discal patches, and basal pale grey suffusion. Large dark patch at distal end of forewing cell. Male underside hind wing median band always dark brown, median band wider than in Common Woolly Legs; lacks copper sheen but only reliably separated by genitalic dissection.
 
These butterflies are always found close to concentrations of aphids, plant Hoppers or scale insects (Homoptera), on which the larvae prey. There are also always ants present, because the larvae shelter during the day in ants' nests. Males are territorial and sit atop bushes or on prominent plants, sallying forth to confront intruders. They fly fast, rapidly circling trees and shrubs harbouring larval prey. Female are sedentary and seldom leave the twigs where the scale insects are feeding.

Small, brilliant scarlet-red lycaenid. Male Dark-banded Scarlet similar to Common Scarlet Axiocerses tjoane tjoane but has line of dark submarginal spots on hind wing upperside. Compared to Black-tipped Scarlet A. coalescens the absence on the male upperside forewing of discal black spots sets that species apart. Bush Scarlet A. amanga amanga has a plain hind wing underside with no brassy spots. The wing edges are more sharply angled than other Scarlets, in both sexes.
 
The underside is deep reddish brown, tending to blackish, with enlarged brassy spots. The forewing has a similar spotting pattern to most Coppers; the hind wing has rows of dark spots with brassy centres.
 
Sexes differ; females are more orange than red on the upperside with a varying extent of rows of dark spotting. They are very difficult to distinguish from the other two similar species, but the angled wing edges may assist.
 
Males are extremely pugnacious hilltoppers. Rapid flight with very fast wingbeats, especially in males. Male perches at midday on low bushes, often upside down, with half-open wings. Females are more often found on flowers and close to host plants.

Brown ground colour varies between subspecies; specimens from higher altitudes, or wetter habitats, become darker on the upperside and more greyish-brown, the hind wing undersides can have distinct reddish discal and postdiscal bands.
 
Hind wing underside sometimes with large ocelli in apical and anal areas, underside forewing basal rust-red patch reaches as far as apical ocellus; hind wing underside grey-brown ground colour irrorated with tiny short dark red-brown striae grouped into ill-defined bands.
 
S. w. grisea is the smallest subspecies, with a more angular wing shape. Upperside ground colour is a paler greyish-brown. The red patches are smaller and the irregular ocelli broadly ringed with pale greyish-ochre. The hind wing underside is also paler with distinct bands of dark striae. The antennae are pale reddish-brown unlike the dark antennae of the other subspecies. Sexes similar, female heavier, with stouter abdomen, and wings more elongated. Female has more sedentary habits.
 
Slow, jinking flight, settling often on rocks, jerkliy opening and closing wings. Visits flowers, where it tends to be less wary.

Identification
Medium-sized white Pierid. Male resembles that of Sabine Albatross White Appias
    epaphia contracta. but is smaller; the critical difference being the yellow
costal streak at the base of the underside hind wing. In Diverse Albatross White both
fore- and hind wings have yellow streaks. Both species are sexually dimorphic, but
their females are totally different and easy to distinguish.
 
Sexually dimorphic, male with brilliant white upperside, dark forewing marginal border broken into spots at vein ends; black spots at hind wing vein ends. Underside of both wings white with yellow costal edge. Female has broad dark borders in both wings.
 
Flies fairly rapidly along the edges of forests, settling often on low vegetation or on flowers.
 
Seasonally polymorphic. Normal wet season form contracta male like a smaller Sabine Albatross White; black upperside marginal spots more diffuse, but present on both wings; underside yellow costal streak in both wings; underside hind wing ground colour plain white. Female has broad dark borders in both wings; in addition has heavy dark suffusion in forewing cell. (A) Male upperside. (B) Male underside. (C) Female upperside. (D) Female underside.

Small butterfly, with bright, deep buff upperside and more rounded wings than the Brauns's Skolly group. Wings rounder, forewing upperside markings less angulate, more exaggerated contrast between light and dark than Mountain Skolly Thestor montanus; not as bright as T. pictus. Less variable than T. montanus or Van Son's Skolly T. vansoni, but the extent and shade of buff does vary somewhat between specimens. Underside hind wing of both sexes has dark, contrasting basal and discal bands of marks; submarginal row of 'V' shaped marks forming a strongly sagittate line.
 
Sexually dimorphic. Females paler than males, distal edges of buff patch noticeably sagittate along veins. Male upperside shows prominent dark scaling along veins. Forewing has an indistinct grey-brown sex brand at the basal juncture of veins M3 and CuA1.
 
T. rooibergensis lives in colonies, usually on mountain slopes covered with scattered large rocks. The females fly more slowly than the males. Flight is low, fast and sustained, dodging between rocks and plants. They settle often on low vegetation or rocks, but are wary and difficult to approach. Usually found in groups of three or four, but in the right conditions can occur in large numbers.

Medium sized butterfly. Battling Glider is the smaller of South Africa's two Cymothoe species; the other being Blonde Glider Cymothoecoranus coranus. Compared to that species, apart from size, C. alcimeda has more angulate wings and, usually, a more heavily marked underside. C. a. trimeni males are very similar to those of C. a. clarki, but the named female forms are different. Sexually dimorphic: male upperside creamy white; both sexes' underside cryptic.
 
Both sexes have the typical Liminitinae gliding flight with bursts of rapid wingbeats. Males perch high up on forest edge trees and shrubs, and sally forth to chase away all other insects. When there is more than one male in a forest clearing, constant aerial battles take place, hence the common name. Females are found close to the host plants. Both sexes regularly drink at wet mud, and nectar from flowers. They are also attracted to fruit bait.

The orange may spread into M3 and 1A+2A, but is not well-defined. On the underside the basal black spots are smaller than in Common Smoky Blue, the white-edged spots in the cell are reduced to white-edged lines, and the postdiscal series of marks are narrower and appear as a broken white-edged line. Where Euchrysops have a well-defined row of postdiscal white sagittate marks, Cupreous Blue has blunt white arches. Females resemble both sexes of Grass Jewel, Chilades trochilus, but that butterfly has three well-defined orange lunules with black spots in M3, CuA1 and CuA2, and sometimes a fourth in M2.
 
Sexually dimorphic. Males are blue on upperside; female upperside black, hind wing has black and orange anal lunule varying in size. Underside of both sexes and both subspp. grey with black spots.

Identification
Tiny dark Skipper with black-and-white chequered upperside and forewing underside. One of a group of very similar little butterflies, which are difficult to tell apart from the upperside markings. To be reasonably sure of identification a clear view of the hind wing underside is necessary. Only South African Spialia besides Bushveld Sandman to have hind wing upperside submarginal spots in M1 and M2 out of line, shifted basally. Forewing apex short and blunt, hind wing underside median band straight, contiguous. Tapers from costa to inner margin as in Delagoa S. delagoae, Boland S. sataspes and Wandering S. depauperata australis Sandmen, but edges jagged as in Forest Sandman S. dromus. Can be told from that species by tiny size and wavy hind wing underside submarginal line.
 
Sexes similar; females usually larger than males, with larger abdomen.
 
Tiny; with its buzzing flight, easily mistaken for a small fly. Male found on sandy patches at edge of bush, among low grass and herbs, often along paths. Usually in flat country although found on hill tops and hillsides further north. Both sexes on flowers, but female very seldom seen.

Medium–small dark Skipper. Upperside blackish brown with greenish yellow hairs and pale spots. Upperside ground colour brown. Has three tiny hyaline subapical spots, and small hyaline spots in areas M2 and M3. Usually, but not always, has two small hyaline spots in forewing cell. Sexes differ in markings in CuA1 and CuA2. Underside medium brown, suffused with white; seven small white discal spots on hind wing in areas 3A to Sc+R1. Cilia plain pale grey-brown. Similar to some of the Borbo Swifts that have yellow or green hairs on the upperside. Rusty Swift Borbo detecta has distinctly reddish yellow ochre hairs. Olive-haired Swift B. borbonica has olive-green hairs but the hind wing underside black-ringed white spots are distinctive. Twin Swift Larsenia gemella has yellowish to greenish ochre hairs, but has only three hind wing underside discal spots.
 
Sexually dimorphic. Male has black forewing discal sex brand diagonally crossing CuA1 and CuA2. Female lacks sex brand; larger than male, wings more elongated, forewing upperside has hyaline discal spot in CuA2, white spot in CuA1. Apart from the different colour of the male sex brand, the number of discal hind wing underside spots distinguishes this species from the very similar White-branded Swift Pelopidas thrax.
 
Males are territorial on hilltops, at edges of forest, along roads, paths or streams, chasing intruding males. Flight rapid, but settling often on low shrubs, grass stems or rocks; fairly easy to approach. Females are more sedentary, around flowers.

Large, dark Charaxes. In certain parts of its range, males can be confused with Blue-Spotted Charaxes, Charaxes cithaeron cithaeron. However, that species has much broader hind wing upperside pale patch, almost totally white. The postdiscal series of forewing royal blue marks are smaller in C. xiphares. Females are distinctive. C. x. bavenda male, with C. x. staudei is distinguished by the suffusion of white into the hind wing upperside discal patch, and broad marginal lunules. The female has the spots near the inner forewing upperside enlarged. There are three female forms. Nominate upperside has white forewing discal spots and yellow hind wing discal patch. In f. ochreomacula the forewing discal spots are tinged with yellow-ochre, and in cyanescens the forewing spots are white but the hind wing patch is white suffused with lavender.
 
Sexes strongly dimorphic, male with royal blue spots and bands on metallic navy ground, female with white discal forewing band (of variable width) sometimes invaded by yellow-ochre. Most females have a pale yellow hind wing upperside patch, but in some populations, it is blue-white or pale mauve. Differences between females is usually of more value than subtle differences between the males in distinguishing subspecies.
 
Powerful, high flight in the canopy and around tree tops. Males territorial, perching high up and pursuing any butterfly (or other flying creature) that ventures nearby. Females fly rapidly along the fringes of forests where they settle on tree leaves.
 
Both sexes are attracted to rotting fruit, animal dung and sap leaking from wounded trees.

Identification
One of a large group of Chrysoritis Opals with blue wing bases and a shimmering, electric opalescent sheen over a varying area of the wings. For Chrysoritis thysbe, amount of blue on upperside varies, in some subspecies almost covering the forewing. Forewing underside has typical 'Copper' pattern of black spots on a pale ground with dark borders. Hind wing underside varies from plain sandy tan to dark brown, to variegated with striae in various shades of reddish-brown, with bands of paler colouring and brassy postdiscal streaks. 'Plain' underside specimens usually have unicoloured cilia; 'variegated' ones dark cilia with pale interneural flecks, appearing 'chequered'.
 
C. t. bamptoni underside may be the plain or variegated form, but the dark striae are always visible. The upperside blue in the male extends beyond the forewing cell to the apex and may cover most of the wing. Margins always dark, but the wing apex usually has some orange. Sexes differ. Female has rounder wings, upperside blue restricted to basal 25% of wings, no opalescent sheen. The females of the various races are almost impossible to separate on wing patterns and identification usually requires comparison with males seen at the same locality.
 
7 subspp., not always geographically distinct. Rapid, sustained flight, settling on prominent bushes or rocks. Male intensively territorial on hill tops or sand dunes, regularly patrolling and chasing intruders; Females are found more at random, often on flowers.
 
(I) Male upperside. (J) Male underside, variegated form. (K) Female upperside. (L) Female underside, plain form. This butterfly flies in the same areas as Lyndsey's Opal C. lyndseyae, but the latter occupies flat areas between prominences - whereas C. thysbe bamptoni is found atop sand dunes.

Small black-and-orange/red butterflies; uppersides are black with varying degrees of red/orange spots and blotches. Undersides are beautifully camouflaged against their habitat; intricate patterns of black or dark grey on a white or pale grey ground, with submarginal spots in varying shades of red to orange, yellow or white. There are some similar species to Amakosa Rocksitter; Natal Rocksitter Durbania limbata upperside has outer half of hind wing broad red; sexes similar and flies in late summer to autumn, not spring and early summer. And Clark's Rocksitter D. clarki is much smaller and its range does not overlap with that of D. amakosa.
 
Sexually dimorphic. D. a. natalensis has the deepest red upperside markings on both wings and in both sexes; the females have very broad orange-red patches. The submarginal hind wing underside dots are red.
 
7 subspp., geographically distinct.
 
Rocksitters, as their name suggests, like to sit on rocks; they do this for long periods with wings closed, their cryptic undersides hiding them well against lichen growing on the rock. Occasionally one will take off and patrol the area searching for mates. The flight is weak and fluttering, and they have trouble with headwinds, so they keep low, in the boundary layer. They lack a proboscis and cannot feed as adults, so they are never seen on flowers.

Back to Top
Identification
Very large, conspicuous black and yellow butterfly with well-developed spatulate tails. Largest South African butterfly. Closest in markings to Citrus Swallowtail Papilio demodocus but much larger and has hind wing tails. Constantine's Swallowtail P. constantinus and Bush Kite P. euphranor are both superficially similar but lack large blue hind wing postdiscal lunules on both wing surfaces. The forewing discal band of spots varies in shape and width between the subspecies.
 
The nominate subspecies is not found in South Africa. P. ophidicephalus zuluensis, like P. o. phalusco, is also very large; this species is found very close to the populations of P. o. phalusco that are largest in size, in the Tugela Valley. It may be that size is determined by environmental conditions and not genetics. The forewing discal band of yellow spots is nearly straight but narrower than in P. o. phalusco and does not widen as much towards the apex. In males the spots in areas R3 to M1 are usually joined; in females the spots may be joined as far down the wing as CuA1. Sexes similar; male has bands of shiny scent scales on forewing between postdiscal and submarginal yellow spots. Females have varying degrees of irroration with yellow scales in these areas.
 
5 subspp., geographically distinct. Flies fast with powerful wingbeats; may stoop low
to investigate flowers. Follows gullies and roads in thick forest. Males are often seen
mud puddling; females on flowers and host plants.

Wingspan
Male 22–28 mm female 23.5–31 mm.
Back to Top
Identification
Similar to a sapphire but upperside brown, with purple sheen in male. Underside superficially resembles certain Iolaus species such as White-spotted and Mimosa Sapphires I. lulua, I. mimosae, but lines narrower and more curved. And of course the upperside is not sapphire blue. The underside is very similar to Coastal Hairstreak Hypolycaena lochmophila. The forewing underside postdiscal line (the middle of the three vertical lines) is evenly curved and does not angle inwards then outwards.
 
Sexes differ on upperside. Female lacks purple sheen of male, and has two white hind wing upperside submarginal white bands, larger anal lunules, tails longer.
 
Males defend territories on forest edges and open bush country, perching on prominent leaves and twigs, and chasing off other butterflies. Females are found on flowers and near the host plants.

Back to Top
Identification
Small bright yellow Pierid. Differs from African Clouded Yellow Colias electo electo in upperside ground colour yellow, not orange, and Spiller's Sulphur Yellow Dixeia spilleri, in that it has broad black borders. Black forewing upperside marginal band scalloped, which sets it apart from other Eurema species except Malagasy Grass Yellow E. floricola. This is a very similar species but Common Grass Yellow can be told from it as follows: underside hind wing cell spot seldom widens towards the apical end, to not more than twice the width of the narrow portion. The hind wing margin is continuously black, or if it is reduced as in dry season individuals, the marks at the end of the veins are linear smudges, not spots. Best identifying feature is where the scalloped edge of forewing upperside black border bends inwards along vein M3, not halfway up area M2 as in Malagasy Grass Yellow (see arrow in (A)).
 
Sexes similar, female paler yellow than male, has grey scaling at upperside wing bases.
 
Fluttering flight, fairly low, along thick forest vegetation, or in open Savanna country. Settles often on flowers or vegetation. Can fly fast if disturbed.
 
Seasonally dimorphic. Dry season form has dark smudges at the hind wing upperside margin vein ends; underside forewing tip carries a square dark patch: (A) Male upperside. (B) Male underside.
 
Wet season form has a continuous dark hind wing upperside marginal band and the underside forewing tip is plain yellow. (C) Male underside.

Bright red-orange Opal, male upperside blue wing patches small, and extent of shifting electric lustre limited. Has similar habits to Beulah's Chrysoritis beulah and Irene's C. irene Opals but they fly in different areas and C. swanepoeli is a darker insect with a variegated underside. Hind wing upperside dark spots limited or absent. Forewing upperside dark borders variable in width; specimens from higher altitudes have more extensive dark markings. Male has large spot at end of forewing cell, which is widely separated from the postdiscal row of spots. Both sexes have prominently chequered cilia. Forewing underside has typical 'Copper' pattern of black spots on a pale ground with dark borders. Hind wing underside strongly variegated with prominent pale costal and discal marks, a pale postdiscal band and well-defined silvery sagittate marks.
 
Sexes differ. Female has little or no basal blue, similar black spotting to other female Chrysoritis spp., and rounded wings.
 
2 subspp., altitudinally separated. Lives in scattered colonies in gullies and dry riverbeds, from the base to the summits of high mountains.

Identification
Small white Pierid with dark upperside spotting. Similar to Brown-veined White Belenois aurota aurota and its relatives, but can be told apart by the forewing cellular spot, which is always large and squarish, never a bar or dumbbell shaped. Underside hind wing and forewing tips appear green as a result of heavy irroration of black and yellow scales and not grey- or brown-black. There are extensive pure yellow markings on the underside, which run into the dark areas. Not seasonally dimorphic but winter specimens have fainter, smaller dark markings.
 
Sexually dimorphic. Female upperside more heavily marked with brownish black; has a submarginal spot just above forewing tornus, lacking in male. Female hind wing has broader brown-black marginal band with white interneural spots.
 
Slow, fluttering flight across open country; males often visit hilltops. Both sexes are fond of flowers; females regularly found near host plants.

Tiny to small butterfly. Males have brown-black upperside, female grey to grey-brown. Undersides are cryptic with patches of beautiful metallic scales. Male very similar to that of Southern Pied Woolly Legs Lachnocnema laches. Male has some similarities to D'Urban's Woolly Legs L. durbani but that butterfly's male has a dull grey-brown upperside and is a denizen of Grassland. Its underside has a regular pattern of buff or pale brown on a grey ground.
 
Sexually dimorphic. Male upperside brown-black, female soft grey to grey-brown with ill-defined blue-grey discal patches, and postdiscal white streaks. Dark spot at distal end of forewing cell. Male underside hind wing has more or less distinct median band of variable width.
 
These butterflies are always found close to concentrations of aphids, plant Hoppers or scale insects (Homoptera), on which the larvae prey. There are also always ants present, because the larvae shelter during the day in ants' nests. Males are territorial and sit atop bushes or on prominent plants, sallying forth to confront intruders. They fly fast, rapidly circling trees and shrubs harbouring larval prey. Female are sedentary and seldom leave the twigs where the scale insects are feeding.

Small, brilliant scarlet-red lycaenid. Male Common Scarlet similar to Dark-banded Scarlet Axiocerses croesus but has no dark submarginal spots on hind wing upperside. Compared to Black-tipped Scarlet A. coalescens the absence on the male upperside forewing of discal black spots sets that species apart. Bush Scarlet A. amanga amanga has a plain hind wing underside with no brassy spots.
 
The underside ground colour varies from pale sandy buff to a deep reddish brown. The forewing has a similar spotting pattern to most Coppers; the hind wing has rows of dark spots with brassy centres.
 
Sexes differ; females are more orange than red on the upperside with a varying extent of rows of dark spotting: they are virtually impossible to distinguish from the other two similar species.
 
Males are extremely pugnacious hilltoppers. Rapid flight with very fast wingbeats, especially in males. Male perches at midday on low bushes, often upside down, with half-open wings. Females are more often found on flowers and close to host plants.

Male &amp; female 20&8211;24 mm.
Back to Top
Identification
Tiny lycaenid; when examined close up the only species that can be confused with it is Purple Gem, Chloroselas mazoensis. Apart from the differences in the male uppersides, the undersides of both sexes can be told apart by the deep buff colour of Brilliant Gem, carrying larger, better defined brassy centred spots. Each hind wing carries a pair of thin tails with white tips at the anal angle.
 
Sexually dimorphic. The male upperside has a shifting, metallic brilliant electric iridescence that shifts from blue to green, over a blackish brown ground colour. This is very beautiful, but only visible when viewed under light coming from the correct acute angle. Female is dullbrown above, sometimes with buff patch in middle of forewing on upperside, and sparse blue scaling, but no electric sheen.
 
Habits similar to Bars, High-fliers and Scarlets but small size and rapid flight makes them difficult to spot amongst the hordes of tiny Babul Blues (Azanus sp.) and Hairtails (Anthene sp.) with which they habitually fly. Occasionally in strong colonies, but more often in groups of 6–8.

Small to medium sized orange butterfly with black bands. One of two species of Joker found in South Africa. Conspicuous, bright orange, small butterfly. Can be told apart from Spotted Joker Byblia ilithyia by lack of black spotting in hind wing upperside discal band. Underside shows considerable seasonal variation; Nominate dry season form hind wing underside crossed with chocolate-brown bands and yellow-white spots. More common wet season form f. similata has yellow-ochre hind wing on underside, basal spots black, submarginal band black with small white spots. Other superficially similar species are Gaudy Commodore Precis octavia sesamus f. natalensis, and Pirate Catacroptera cloanthe. The former lacks the pale underside markings and the latter has a plain underside.
 
Sexes similar in markings: male much brighter orange than female, edges of black marks better defined.
 
Active, erratic flight, usually not more than 1–2m above the ground, in open grassy areas and between bushes. Frequently settles on plants but seldom flowers, wings open, slowly 'pumping' them. Like B. ilithyia and Danaus chrysippus, commonly seen sucking grass flowerheads, behaviour that is not currently understood as grasses do not produce nectar. Both sexes are attracted to fallen fruit and come readily to traps baited with this.

Small brown butterfly with black upperside markings. Large for a Thestor; unique and unmistakable; does not fit into any of the Skolly groups. Brown, as opposed to buff or grey; build more robust than other Skollies and female has distinctive white forewing upperside black and white markings. Underside is pale grey-buff with discal area of forewing whitish, with black basal and postdiscal spots. Hind wing basal and postdiscal series are a darker buff-grey.
 
Sexually dimorphic. Males have acutely pointed forewing and straight outer margin. Females have blunt-ended forewings and convex outer margin Extent of white on both wings of female is extremely variable. Some specimens are distinctly pied; others have hardly any white and are all dun-brown with heavy black forewing blotches. Nominate subspecies T. b. basuta males have pointed wing tips and the forewing discal area is usually pale grey-brown with darker brown or black marks. The female varies greatly as described, and very dark individuals can be found flying with pale pied examples that would answer to the description of T. b. capeneri.
 
2 subspp., geographically distinct.
 
Male flies fast, settling often on the ground or on stones. Females are sluggish and usually seen flying slowly, close to the ground, seeking out oviposition spots.

Large, dark Charaxes. In certain parts of its range, males can be confused with Blue-Spotted Charaxes, Charaxes cithaeron cithaeron. However, that species has much broader hind wing upperside pale patch, almost totally white. The postdiscal series of forewing royal blue marks are smaller in C. xiphares. Females are distinctive. C. x. kenwayi is a small race. The male has enlarged blue marks on the upperside. There are two female forms. Nominate has a white hind wing upperside discal patch. f. lutea, which is the dominant form, has a yellow patch.
 
Sexes strongly dimorphic, male with royal blue spots and bands on metallic navy ground, female with white discal forewing band (of variable width) sometimes invaded by yellow-ochre. Most females have a pale yellow hind wing upperside patch, but in some populations, it is blue-white or pale mauve. Differences between females is usually of more value than subtle differences between the males in distinguishing subspecies.
 
Powerful, high flight in the canopy and around tree tops. Males territorial, perching high up and pursuing any butterfly (or other flying creature) that ventures nearby. Females fly rapidly along the fringes of forests where they settle on tree leaves.
 
Both sexes are attracted to rotting fruit, animal dung and sap leaking from wounded trees.
