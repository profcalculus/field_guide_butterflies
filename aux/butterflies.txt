Identification
A shade-loving butterfly that is usually seen fluttering among undergrowth along forest paths, and settling on leaves or tree bark. Its upperside is brightly coloured and conspicuous in flight; underside is well camouflaged against dead leaves and bark. The sexes are similar; females are slightly larger and paler on the upperside.
 
Four subspecies, geographically separated.

Back to Top
Identification
Very small dark Skipper with black-and-white chequered upperside and forewing underside. One of a group of very similar little butterflies, which are difficult to tell apart from the upperside markings. This species is more distinctive than the others in that [i]none of the upperside markings form bands[/i]; they are all discrete spots. Forewing apex [i]markedly pointed[/i], hind wing underside [i]distinctly spotted[/i]. Hind wing submarginal spots at M1, and M2 [i]do not form a smooth line with the rest of[/i] [i]series[/i], they are placed more basally. Hind wing underside spots mirror those on upperside, [i]large, white, rounded[/i] and separated on brown-grey background. Cilia chequered.
 
Sexes similar; females usually larger than males, with [i]larger abdomen[/i].
 
Fast, buzzing, low flight, settling often, wings open. Male patrols territory among thorn trees, often on low, shaded vegetation in flat country or on lower slopes of hills. Female found with males, flying randomly in search of nectar or host plant.

Also resembles Pennington's Buff [i]Cnodontes penningtoni[/i] and Pallid Buff [i]C. pallida[/i] but underside orange marks are discrete spots and always present in [i]B. aslanga[/i]; form indistinct bands and are often absent in [i]Cnodontes[/i] spp. Also, both sexes of [i]Cnodontes[/i] carry one dark costal mark just outside the forewing cell and do not have dark costal marks at the base of the forewing as in [i]Baliochila[/i] spp.
 
Sexually dimorphic. Male has [i]larger[/i] dark forewing tip; [i]dark band[/i] covering basal half of forewing costa, and [i]large dark blotch[/i] distal to end of cell, spreading to CuA1. Female has forewing costal dark spots interspersed with ground colour.
 
Weak, fluttering flight. Usually flies high in canopy, but sometimes found lower down. Settles on twigs, wings closed; periodically suddenly opening them. When doing this it resembles a tiny yellowed leaf waving in the breeze. Occasionally found roosting communally. Female flies lower, searching for oviposition sites. Often found in small groups, imbibing honeydew from scale insects on twigs or leaves.

Sexes similar; females usually larger and paler than males.
 
Males show very territorial behaviour; they choose a prominent twig or leaf and [i]scent-mark[/i] it with a touch of the black-haired anal tuft; behaviour unique in diurnal lepidoptera. On this they perch and make circular sorties around their territory, a 'beat' from which the common name derives. Females are more sedentary and are usually found near the host plants.

The only South African [i]Kedestes[/i] species with similarly marked uppersides are Macomo Ranger [i]K. macomo[/i], which has several black spots and streaks on the underside, and Pale Ranger [i]K. callicles[/i] which has [i]black-ringed white blotches[/i]. Upperside resembles that of larger Orange-spotted Hopper [i]Zenonia zeno[/i] but the forewing base is [i]not solid orange[/i].
 
Sexes similar, female paler than male, rounder, more elongated wings, abdomen stouter, forewing upperside spots [i]more developed[/i].
 
Males hilltop on koppies and ridges at midday, perching on prominent stones, rocks or vegetation, fast and whirling flight, returning to the same perch. Females more sedentary, seldom seen, usually seeking oviposition sites and feeding on flowers.

Resembles a small Blotched Leopard [i]Lachnoptera ayresi[/i], but its wings are [i]more rounded[/i]. The dark markings do not form blotches, and the ground colour is paler. Primarily a woodland species, but penetrates Grassland areas and gardens where Willows ([i]Salix[/i] spp) and White Poplar [i]Populus alba[/i] host plants are found.
 
Sexes similar; females tend to be larger and paler than the males.
 
Flight is fast and energetic, settling often on the ground with wings 'pumping' up and down. Very fond of mud puddles, rotting fruit and animal faeces.

The underside is paler than in [i]P. euphranor[/i], with dark 'rays' running between the veins on the postdiscal areas of both wings.
 
Sexes similar; females usually larger and paler than males.
 
Retiring habits, showing a preference for the shade of thick bush, wooded valleys and sand forests. Has the typical swallowtail fluttering, swooping flight, restless, seldom sitting still when nectaring. Like all Swallowtails it often sits on wet mud, drinking - especially males, where animals have urinated on the mud.

Small sapphire. Upperside superficially similar to Red-line Sapphire [i]Iolaus sidus[/i], but dark median line crosses hind wing, and forewing blue [i]less extensive, not as bright[/i]. Underside has [i]conspicuous black-edged orange-yellow bands[/i] crossing underside of both wings. Very similar on both surfaces to Yellow-banded Sapphire [i]Iolaus aphnaeoides[/i] and close to Zimbabwe Yellow-banded Sapphire [i]I. nasisii[/i]. The three butterflies have very different ranges. The difference to [i]I. aphnaeoides[/i] is the tiny black marginal line at the inner marginal side of the anal angle. In [i]I. diametra natalica[/i] it is [i]double[/i]. The underside bands are much narrower than those of [i]I. nasisii[/i].
 
Sexes differ; female with wings more rounded, and white edge to forewing upperside blue; area distal to hind wing upperside postdiscal transverse dark stripe [i]white[/i], not [i]blue[/i] as in male.
 
Compared to other sapphires, flight slow; may fly close to ground. Flies away rapidly if disturbed, but usually does not go far, and may return. Female closer to host plant. Both sexes are fond of flowers.

Medium–small white Pierid with black band encircling the forewing upperside. Extent of upperside black varies, and underside ground colour varies from white to pale pink, depending on the seasonal form.
 
Sexually dimorphic. Male upperside has [i]glossy black forewing upperside basal band[/i]; golden yellow wing tip has [i]flame-like blue iridescence[/i]. Females lack the iridescence, and upperside ground colour varies from white to yellow.
 
Fast-flying and elusive, but often settles on flowers where it can be approached closely.
 
Normal wet season form [i]eris[/i] has prominent dark upperside markings in both sexes. Both sexes have [i]black marginal dots[/i] on the hind wing upperside. Male has [i]more extensive[/i] hind wing upperside costal black, marginal forewing band carries [i]no[/i] pale marks. Female pattern similar to male. Underside white, usually with yellow-orange hind wing costal streak. (A) Male upperside. (B) Female upperside. (C), (D) Female undersides.
 
Female form [i]abyssinicus[/i] resembles form [i]eris[/i] but has [i]yellow ground colour[/i]. (E) Female upperside. (F) Female underside.
 
The usual dry season form, [i]fatma[/i], has black markings [i]more restricted[/i], with [i]pale markings[/i] in marginal black. Female paler than form [i]eris[/i] or form [i]abyssinicus[/i], with varying amount of marginal dark marking on white forewing upperside background. The outer edge of the upperside forewing tip is [i]brown, not black[/i]. Underside hind wing of both sexes [i]white to pale pink[/i]. (G) Male upperside. (H) Female upperside. (I) Female underside.
 
To the north-west, dry season form [i]damara[/i] predominates. Both sexes have [i]more extensive[/i] pale markings in marginal black than form [i]fatma[/i]. Female has no brown in forewing tips. (J) Male upperside. (K) Male underside. (L) Female underside.
 
In the E Cape, form [i]johnstoni[/i] is normal. Unlike other forms, the male has a [i]black spot in the forewing upperside cell[/i]; female's dark forewing upperside marks [i]much reduced[/i], to the point where they are broken into spots and margin is [i]completely white[/i]; tip [i]very pale brown[/i]; merges into pale margin.

Distinguished from Golden Piper [i]Eurytela dryope angulata[/i] which has [i]orange bands[/i] that spread [i]as far as the outer margin[/i].
 
Sexes similar.
 
It has a slow, floating, gliding flight, wings held open with sporadic rapid wingbeats. Males form territories, usually on a prominent bush on the forest edge, and pursue other butterflies that approach. Wary and difficult to approach, if disturbed it flies off between the branches and is hard to follow. Both sexes are attracted to fallen, rotting fruit, and come readily to fruit bait.

Compared to Lipara Buff [i]Baliochila lipara[/i], Common Buff [i]B. aslanga[/i], Pallid Buff [i]C. pallida[/i] and Pennington's Buff [i]Cnodontes penningtoni[/i] it is [i]larger[/i] and has [i]no[/i] basal or discal upperside forewing marks, except for a [i]dark brown to black[/i] wingtip which narrows into a costal band, which extends without break, fading to the ground colour as it reaches the base.
 
Sexes similar; male has small raised bar of scent scales at base of forewing upperside.
 
Shy and retiring habits, slow flight with rapid wingbeats, but making little progress. They gather in groups of several specimens, feeding on honeydew secreted by scale insects quite high in the canopy, 3 to 6metres up. The butterflies walk slowly around these insects, their camouflaged undersides making them almost impossible to spot. They hardly ever fly unless deliberately flushed, and the best way to see them is to patiently tap the foliage of suitable trees in the habitat. If a group is disturbed they will fly out, with peculiar fast flapping wingbeats. Although the flight is slow, if chased they can put on a respectable turn of speed.

Underside variable shade of brown; female with distinctive white median marks mirroring those on upperside; distinguished from Karkloof Emperor [i]Charaxes karkloof[/i] by black discal line intersecting hind wing vein CuA proximally to the split with M3.
 
Sexually dimorphic; four recognised female forms. Nominate female form has [i]whitish[/i] forewing upperside discal band, [i]blue[/i] in f. [i]swynnertoni[/i], orange tinged, fading basally to [i]white[/i] in f. [i]aurantimaculata[/i]. Intermediates between latter and nominate are common. Form [i]rosae[/i] has [i]curved[/i] (not straight, as in other female forms) band on upperside, always white. Hind wing of all four female forms carries white median band, surrounded by extensive bluish sheen.
 
Fast, agile, high flight. Males territorial in forest canopy, perching high up and pursuing any butterfly (or other flying creature) that ventures nearby. Females fly more slowly, low along the fringes of forests where they settle on tree leaves.
 
Both sexes are attracted to rotting fruit, animal dung and sap leaking from wounded trees. They are also often seen drinking from wet mud.

Identification
Medium-sized brown butterfly with paler bands and blotches. Most familiar and widespread [i]Precis[/i] species in South Africa. It has two seasonal forms, which are different in appearance and habits. Both forms have a brown upperside ground colour with a broad postdiscal band and basal blotches of paler colouring. Wet season (summer) form postdiscal band is bright cream to orange-buff. Could be confused with Dry-leaf Commodore [i]Precis tugela[/i] or Soldier Pansy [i]Junonia terea elgiva[/i] but underside [i]similar to upperside[/i]; does not have dead leaf appearance. Dry season (winter) form upperside postdiscal bands are [i]maroon-red[/i]; marginal, apical and cell spots pale blue to white. Underside resembles a dead, dry leaf in shades of dark green, olive and pinkish white to buff. Intermediates quite common; usually in the form of dry season form with postdiscal band of deep buff.
 
Sexes similar, female with wings rounder.
 
Flies at low height to a metre or two above the ground. Short glides interspersed with bursts of rapid wingbeats. Flies away rapidly if disturbed; males strongly territorial, sitting on prominent point, chasing away intruders. and if chased away, usually returning to where first seen. Summer form is a very active butterfly, usually found on open hillsides and summits. Winter form is more skulking, found more often gardens and woods near montane Grassland, or along stream banks. It hibernates in deep gullies and under banks and rocks.
 
Dry season form f. [i]archesia[/i] upperside is brown, [i]maroon and blue[/i]. Wet season form f. [i]pelasgis[/i] brown, with [i]cream to buff[/i] postdiscal bands.

Sexes similar, female with wings more rounded.
 
Rapid, sustained flight over mountain summits and down gullies, settling infrequently on flowers. Like all [i]Pseudonympha[/i] and related species it opens its wings on settling only to snap them closed an instant later. This behaviour, coupled with its steep mountain haunts, makes it hazardous to photograph!.

[i]E. hiarbas[/i] has a white bar that does not reach the outer margin.
 
Sexes similar.
 
It has a slow, floating, gliding flight, wings held open with sporadic rapid wingbeats. Males form territories, usually on a prominent bush, and pursue other butterflies that approach. Wary and difficult to approach, if disturbed it flies off between the branches and is hard to follow. It is sometimes found in Savanna country. Both sexes are attracted to fallen, rotting fruit, and come readily to fruit bait.

One of South Africa's most striking small Blues. One of several small lycaenids with stark white undersides dotted with black. Distinguished from White [i]Tuxentius calice calice[/i] and Black [i]T. melaena[/i] Pies by [i]presence of blue on upperside[/i] and on the underside by the [i]row of three black apical spots separate[/i] where the Pies have a bar. Distinguished from Dotted Blue [i]Tarucus sybaris[/i] by [i]less even[/i] pattern of black dots on the underside, and the [i]submarginal row of short bars[/i] where Dotted Blue has only dots.
 
Sexes differ. Male has [i]glittering, semi-transparent blue[/i]. Female is a white butterfly with black dots following those on the underside; bases of wings carry a varying amount of blue.
 
Rapid, fluttering flight, not far off the ground. Difficult to separate on the wing from [i]Tuxentius[/i] or [i]Tarucus[/i] spp. Some specimens have been photographed from the N Cape that have the underside black spots reduced as in the Namibian subspecies [i]Z. hintza krooni[/i], but the male upperside has not been recorded.

Identification
Medium to large (for a lycaenid), showy sapphire with distinctive pattern of black-and-white postdiscal blotches and basal violaceous blue on the forewing, and streaked pattern of white, violaceous blue and grey-black on the hind wing. The only similar species in South Africa is Dusky Sapphire, [i]S. subinfuscata reynoldsi[/i], but the upperside violaceous blue colouring tends to be [i]lighter[/i]. The major difference is on the underside, where the marginal bands and the area basal to the hind wing dark median band are [i]pale grey or white[/i], not dark grey.
 
The sexes are very similar; females tend to have [i]more extensive[/i] white in the apical area of the forewing upperside. [i]S. b. tearei[/i] is on average the largest and most widespread subspecies. The white upperside markings are larger and more extensive, and the white areas on the underside less suffused with dull grey.
 
3 subspp., geographically distinct. Flight fast, but slower than other sapphires. Males perch alert on or in prominent bushes on low rocky ridges, chasing intruders; female more sedentary, more usually found near host plants.

Small black-and-orange/red butterflies; uppersides are black with varying degrees of red/orange spots and blotches. Undersides are beautifully camouflaged against their habitat; intricate patterns of black or dark grey on a white or pale grey ground, with submarginal spots in varying shades of red to orange, yellow or white. There are some similar species to Amakosa Rocksitter; Natal Rocksitter [i]Durbania limbata[/i] upperside has outer half of hind wing [i]broad[/i] red; sexes similar and flies in late summer to autumn, not spring and early summer. And Clark's Rocksitter [i]D. clarki[/i] is much smaller and its range does not overlap with that of [i]D. amakosa[/i].
 
Sexually dimorphic. [i]D. a. penningtoni[/i] has the palest upperside spots and bands of all the subspecies. It varies from yellow-buff in most males, to almost yellow in the large females, which when they have the broadest bands, can be mistaken for Yellow Pansy [i]Junonia hierta cebrene[/i] on the wing.
 
7 subspp., geographically distinct.
 
Rocksitters, as their name suggests, like to sit on rocks; they do this for long periods with wings closed, their cryptic undersides hiding them well against lichen growing on the rock. Occasionally one will take off and patrol the area searching for mates. The flight is weak and fluttering, and they have trouble with headwinds, so they keep low, in the boundary layer. They lack a proboscis and cannot feed as adults, so they are never seen on flowers.

One of a large group of [i]Chrysoritis[/i] Opals with [i]blue wing bases[/i] and a [i]shimmering, electric opalescent sheen[/i] over a varying area of the wings. For [i]Chrysoritis thysbe[/i], amount of blue on upperside varies, in some subspecies almost covering the forewing. Forewing underside has typical 'Copper' pattern of black spots on a pale ground with dark borders. Hind wing underside varies from plain sandy tan to dark brown, to [i]variegated[/i] with striae in various shades of reddish-brown, with bands of paler colouring and brassy postdiscal streaks. 'Plain' underside specimens usually have unicoloured cilia; 'variegated' ones dark cilia with pale interneural flecks, appearing 'chequered'.
 
[i]C. t. osbecki[/i] usually has unicoloured cilia and plain underside; may be found flying together with nominate. Sexes differ. Female has [i]rounder wings[/i], upperside blue [i]restricted to basal 25% of wings[/i], no opalescent sheen. The females of the various races are almost impossible to separate on wing patterns and identification usually requires comparison with males seen at the same locality.
 
7 subspp., not always geographically distinct. Rapid, sustained flight, settling on prominent bushes or rocks. Male intensively territorial on hill tops or sand dunes, regularly patrolling and chasing intruders; Females are found more at random, often on flowers.

Medium to large butterfly, with weak but sustained fluttering flight, sometimes sailing, at medium height, 2–3m above the ground. Usually found flying alone or in small groups, but may be found in large numbers on wounded plants exuding pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Fond of nectar. This species has complex biogeography; it is widespread across Asia, southern Europe and the whole of Africa. Several subspecies occur across this range, the relationship between these is the subject of several studies.
 
Sexes similar; males have large dark spot in area CuA2 of hind wing; black on upperside, white-centred on underside.
 
[i]Danaus chrysippus alcippus[/i] is the common subspecies in Central and West Africa, and varies as to the extent and depth of the chocolate-brown basal suffusion.
 
It is possible that the appearance of forms resembling [i]D. c. alcippus[/i] among the South African [i]D. c. orientis[/i] population is a result of edge-of-range interbreeding with those races when climatic conditions make this possible.

Males show very territorial behaviour; they choose a prominent twig or leaf in the territory. On this they perch and make circular sorties around their territory, a 'beat' from which the common name derives. Females are more sedentary and are usually found near the host plants. May be found swarming in large numbers under suitable conditions.

Identification
Medium-sized white Pierid with coloured or black forewing tips. Very similar to Bushveld Purple Tip [i]Colotis ione[/i]. Male upperside always white; black forewing apical tip with [i]three[/i] discrete metallic purple cells and [i]no[/i] grey scaling in the black border. Some specimens have a tiny extra spot of purple on costal edge of tip, [i]never four full-sized spots[/i] as in Bushveld Purple Tip. Also, purple [i]less obviously shiny[/i] and iridescent. Queen Purple Tip [i]C. regina[/i] has a distinct two-tone purple-green 'flop' in the wing tip, and is [i]larger[/i]. Underside varies from pinkish white in all dry season forms, to deep yellow in wet season forms; distinctive dark markings remain the same.
 
Sexually dimorphic; males always have a [i]purple[/i] upperside forewing tip; females
have two colour morphs - [i]orange-tipped[/i] and [i]black-tipped[/i].
Orange-tipped forms have [i]four dark spots[/i] in the orange, compared to
[i]five[/i] in female f. [i]ione[/i] orange-tipped forms. Black-tipped forms [i]three pale spots[/i] compared with four to five in dark-tipped forms of female Bushveld Purple Tip.
 
Fast, erratic flight, jinking in various directions but maintaining a steady course. Settles seldom except to feed at flowers. In cloudy weather may stop to bask in sunny patches. Females are less often seen than males because they are more retiring, but also often come to flowers.
 
Seasonally polymorphic. Male wet season form [i]erone[/i] has black veins on hind wing upperside and on edge of forewing tip. (A) Male upperside. (B) Male underside.

Also [i]larger, paler[/i], underside basal areas patterned in [i]ochre-red[/i], not dark red. The grey areas of the underside are a darker shade of silver.
 
Other similar species are the much larger, darker Giant Charaxes, [i]C. castor flavifasciatus[/i], and White-barred Charaxes, [i]C. brutus natalensis[/i], which is black on the upperside with a white median band. The former has a [i]yellow[/i] upperside median band and no tawny forewing basal patch. Both species have similar undersides to [i]C. saturnus saturnus[/i] but they have far less silver grey and more dark red.
 
Sexes similar, female with tails longer than male.
 
Flight fast and energetic. Males are very territorial, hilltopping and perching on prominent twigs on bushes, and pursuing any butterfly (or other flying creature) that ventures nearby. Attracted to rotting fruit, animal dung and sap leaking from wounded trees.

Identification
Separated from similar False Silver-bottom Brown by [i]P. magoides[/i] having
anally more [i]pointed[/i] hind wing with three submarginal ocelli. The ocelli are never
'blind'. Underside hind wing ground colour also silvery grey, but more or less
covered with [i]brownish markings[/i]. Colouration variable, from pure silver grey with
plain dark marginal border, to having varying amounts of red-brown [i]striation[/i].
Hind wing underside discal band [i]red-brown[/i], prominent to indistinct. Specimens
from lower altitude populations in KwaZulu-Natal tend to have more rounded wings and darker brown underside markings than high altitude specimens from Lesotho and the E Cape. This butterfly is the subject of biogeographical studies and may comprise more than one species or subspecies. The God's Window population is possibly one of these. More information on northern populations is desirable.
 
Similar Swanepoel's Brown [i]P. swanepoeli[/i] has fewer ocelli and differences in the marginal dark lines on hind wing underside.

Upperside warm grey-brown, with square hyaline discal series of spots on forewing; hind wing has straight series of whitish discal spots in areas M2 to CuA2. Underside [i]dull ochre-yellow[/i], forewing [i]blackish basally[/i], hind wing has dark smudge in cell and a series of dark smudges distal to pale spots that follow the upperside pattern. Cilia plain whitish-cream. Similar to Marsh Swift [i]Borbo micans[/i] but that butterfly [i]lacks hind wing underside spotting[/i]. Underside resembles that of Common Hottentot Skipper [i]Gegenes niso niso[/i] and Marsh Hottentot Skipper [i]G. hottentota[/i]; hind wing has [i]only one row of dark marks[/i], not [i]two[/i] as in those species.
 
Sexes similar; female resembles male, has larger pale markings, rounder wings, a larger abdomen, and an extra forewing hyaline spot in CuA2.
 
Low, fast, erratic flight, settling often on low vegetation. Males perch on grass leaves and low plants, darting out to challenge rivals, returning to their original perch. Females are found more at random, searching for oviposition sites.

Sexes similar, but male has [i]narrower, more triangular[/i] wings.
 
Although this is a small Charaxes it lacks nothing in speed of flight or, in the male, pugnacity. Males form territories on hilltops, or in flat country, around prominent bushes and trees. They pursue any butterfly (or other flying creature) that ventures nearby. Females are found close to the host plants, or wandering around searching for males.
 
Both sexes are attracted to rotting fruit, animal dung and sap leaking from wounded trees.

[i]only the hind wing has a yellow streak[/i]. Both species are sexually dimorphic, but
their females are totally different and easy to distinguish.
 
Sexually dimorphic, male with [i]brilliant white[/i] upperside, dark forewing marginal border [i]broken into spots at vein ends[/i]; black spots at hind wing vein ends. Underside hind wing white with [i]yellow costal edge[/i]. There are two female forms. More common female f.

Black forewing upperside marginal band [i]scalloped[/i], which sets it apart from other [i]Eurema[/i] species except Common Grass Yellow [i]E. hecabe[/i]. This is a very similar species but Malagasy Grass Yellow can be told from it as follows: underside hind wing cell spot [i]strongly widens towards the apical end[/i], to more than [i]twice the width of the narrow portion[/i]. The hind wing margin is [i]continuously black[/i], or if it is reduced as in dry season individuals, the [i]marks at the end of the veins are discrete spots, not linear smudges[/i]. Best identifying feature is where the scalloped edge of forewing upperside black border bends inwards halfway up area M2, not along vein M3 as in Common Grass Yellow (see arrow in (A)).
 
Sexes similar, female [i]paler yellow[/i] than male, has grey scaling at upperside wing bases.
 
Flies rapidly along thick forest vegetation, settling occasionally on flowers or vegetation.
 
Seasonally dimorphic.
 
Dry season form has dark smudges at the hind wing upperside margin vein ends; underside forewing tip carries a [i]square dark patch[/i]: (A) Female upperside. (B) Male underside.

Medium-sized butterfly. Battling Glider is the smaller of South Africa's two [i]Cymothoe[/i] species; the other being Blonde Glider [i]Cymothoecoranus coranus[/i]. Compared to that species, apart from size, [i]C. alcimeda[/i] has [i]more angulate[/i] wings and, usually, a more [i]heavily marked[/i] underside. Nominate subspecies [i]C. a. alcimeda[/i] male upperside is distinctive with big dark mark at end of forewing cell. Sexually dimorphic: there is only one female form of the nominate subspecies, but there is more than one subspecies and those females are polymorphic. Male upperside creamy white; both sexes' underside cryptic.
 
Both sexes have the typical Limenitidinae gliding flight with bursts of rapid wingbeats. Males perch high up on forest edge trees and shrubs, and sally forth to chase away all other insects. When there is more than one male in a forest clearing, constant aerial battles take place, hence the common name. Females are found close to the host plants. Both sexes regularly drink at wet mud, and nectar from flowers. They are also attracted to fruit bait.

Of the Bars, genus [i]Cigaritis[/i] this is on average the largest, and the most
widespread. Like Mozambique Bar [i]Cigaritis mozambica[/i] the underside dark bars are
[i]straight[/i], which sets them apart from the other three species found in South Africa.
Compared to that species the underside ground colour is [i]paler[/i] and the bars
[i]brown[/i], not orange. Each hind wing carries a pair of thin tails with white tips at
the anal angle. There are two forms; the nominate, with prominent orange and black
forewing upperside bars, is commoner. f. [i]obscurus[/i], which has the orange more or

Identification
Medium to large (for a lycaenid), showy sapphire with distinctive pattern of black-and-white postdiscal blotches and basal violaceous blue on the forewing, and streaked pattern of white, violaceous blue and grey-black on the hind wing. The only similar species in South Africa is Dusky Sapphire, [i]S. subinfuscata reynoldsi[/i], but the upperside violaceous blue colouring tends to be [i]lighter[/i]. The major difference is on the underside, where the marginal bands and the area basal to the hind wing dark median band are [i]pale grey or white[/i], not dark grey.
 
The sexes are very similar; females tend to have [i]more extensive[/i] white in the apical area of the forewing upperside. Nominate subspecies [i]S. b. bowkeri[/i] is variable in the extent of the white upperside areas, and the width and shade of the dark brown lines crossing the underside. The white upperside forewing marks tend to be elongated and 'streaky' in appearance compared to the other subspecies, and the underside more or less suffused with dull grey.
 
3 subspp., geographically distinct. Flight fast, but slower than other sapphires. Males perch alert on or in prominent bushes on low rocky ridges, chasing intruders; female more sedentary, more usually found near host plants. Both sexes attracted to flowers, such as Puzzlebush [i]Ehretia rigida[/i], sometimes in numbers.

Identification
Small black-and-orange/red butterflies; uppersides are black with varying degrees of red/orange spots and blotches. Undersides are beautifully camouflaged against their habitat; intricate patterns of black or dark grey on a white or pale grey ground, with submarginal spots in varying shades of red to orange, yellow or white. There are some similar species to Amakosa Rocksitter; Natal Rocksitter [i]Durbania limbata[/i] upperside has outer half of hind wing [i]broad[/i] red; sexes similar and flies in late summer to autumn, not spring and early summer. And Clark's Rocksitter [i]D. clarki[/i] is much smaller and its range does not overlap with that of [i]D. amakosa[/i].
 
Sexually dimorphic. In most subspecies, male has small red-orange to red spots on jet-black ground colour, female with upperside more orange-red. Far southern subspecies [i]D. a. amakosa[/i] has narrow, broken buff-orange bands on the upperside. As one goes further north, as in [i]D. a. ayresi[/i], the orange areas are more extensive, in some, almost covering the upperside.
 
7 subspp., geographically distinct.
 
Rocksitters, as their name suggests, like to sit on rocks; they do this for long periods with wings closed, their cryptic undersides hiding them well against lichen growing on the rock. Occasionally one will take off and patrol the area searching for mates. The flight is weak and fluttering, and they have trouble with headwinds, so they keep low, in the boundary layer. They lack a proboscis and cannot feed as adults, so they are never seen on flowers.
 
Nominate subspecies [i]D. a. amakosa[/i] has the dullest red markings and the female has the least extent of red. In some colonies the female has rows of spots like the male; in others the red marks are fused into bands. (A) Male upperside. (B) Female underside. (C), (D) Male undersides.

Back to Top
Identification
Large white or yellow-buff Pierid with dark margins. Often mistaken for very similar Common Dotted Border [i]Mylothris agathina[/i] in both sexes, but the distinguishing factor is the [i]row of black hind wing marginal dots[/i]. In Common Dotted Border these are [i]confined to the margin[/i]. In [i]Belenois thysa thysa[/i] there is an [i]extra row of submarginal black dots[/i]. There are other differences; the flight pattern is more robust and some female forms of False Dotted Border have [i]extensive dark basal patches[/i], which is never the case with the Common Dotted Border. The hind wing underside is [i]always bright canary yellow[/i].
 
Sexually dimorphic; males are always [i]white[/i] on the upperside with [i]dark marginal and submarginal marks[/i] varying in extent according to seasonal form. Females' upperside patterns also vary according to seasonal form, and have [i]varying amounts of colour and dark shading[/i].
 
Male flies fast, high along forest edges, occasionally settles on flowers; female slower, settles more often.
 
Seasonally polymorphic. Wet season form is [i]thysa[/i]; male upperside has [i]large, extensive[/i] dark marginal markings; submarginal series always visible on hind wing upperside. Female variable; always has [i]pale orange blush[/i] at forewing upperside base. Some specimens have [i]extensive basal and discal dark grey-black patches[/i]. (A) Male upperside. (B) Male underside.

One of a large group of [i]Chrysoritis[/i] Opals with [i]blue wing bases[/i] and a [i]shimmering, electric opalescent sheen[/i] over a varying area of the wings. For [i]Chrysoritis thysbe[/i], amount of blue on upperside varies, in some subspecies almost covering the forewing. Forewing underside has typical 'Copper' pattern of black spots on a pale ground with dark borders. Hind wing underside varies from plain sandy tan to dark brown, to [i]variegated[/i] with striae in various shades of reddish-brown, with bands of paler colouring and brassy postdiscal streaks. 'Plain' underside specimens usually have unicoloured cilia; 'variegated' ones dark cilia with pale interneural flecks, appearing 'chequered'.
 
[i]C. t. schloszae[/i] in the male, solid blue covers forewing cell spot and usually extends slightly beyond. Outer margin usually has [i]narrow orange border[/i]; may be limited to the cilia, which are only weakly chequered. Hind wing underside is consistently light brown variegated with striae and silvery white streaks. Sexes differ. Female has [i]rounder wings[/i], upperside blue [i]restricted to basal 25% of wings[/i], no opalescent sheen. The females of the various races are almost impossible to separate on wing patterns and identification usually requires comparison with males seen at the same locality.
 
7 subspp., not always geographically distinct. Rapid, sustained flight, settling on prominent bushes or rocks. Male intensively territorial on hill tops or sand dunes, regularly patrolling and chasing intruders; Females are found more at random, often on flowers.

[i]Smallest[/i] and most abundant South African Tree Nymph. Compared to [i]Sevenia natalensis[/i] and [i]Sevenia morantii[/i], underside is more heavily mottled with pale grey and buff, submarginal row of prominent black spots always present.
 
Sexually dimorphic. Male upperside flat brown, with [i]reddish-ringed black submarginal spots on hind wing[/i]. Female has apical black patch with orange blotches. Prominent submarginal row of black spots on both sexes' uppersides.
 
Fond of sitting on tree bark, also roosts under leaves. Flipping, short flight from tree trunk to tree trunk. Very wary and hard to approach closely. Sometimes in swarms of many thousands in late summer. The gregarious larvae may totally defoliate even large specimens of the host plant, and when the adults emerge they give the impression that the tree has brown leaves. Drinks from wet mud.

Small bright orange Skipper. Upperside dark brown with prominent [i]orange bands[/i]; the entire discal area of the forewing is orange, totally enclosing an 'arrowhead'-shaped mark in the cell and the area distal to it. Cilia plain yellowish white. Underside orange-yellow; forewing has [i]black spot at end of cell[/i], and [i]dark blotch near the tornus[/i] that extends to the inner margin in the darker forms. Hind wing has [i]distinct pale buff streaks edged with dark brown[/i] on an orange ground. This is unique in Skippers found in South Africa. Upperside similar to Axehead Orange [i]Acada biseriata[/i] but the forewing upperside costal orange streak [i]joins the apical orange patch[/i] to form a [i]continuous band around the dark 'arrowhead' mark[/i] in the cell. Also similar to Morant's Orange [i]Parosmodes morantii[/i], but forewing upperside orange cell spot is [i]merged with postdiscal orange band[/i]. Upperside also resembles that of larger Orange-spotted Hopper [i]Zenonia zeno[/i] but the forewing base is [i]not solid orange[/i] and the orange discal band is [i]not fused[/i].
 
Further north there are three forms - nominate, form [i]ruso[/i] and form [i]merops[/i]. The specimens found to date in South Africa appear to be form [i]ruso[/i], which is paler than the nominate, which has wider upperside dark margins and 'arrowhead' markings. Form [i]merops[/i] has [i]more extensive upperside orange[/i], with narrower upperside dark margins and very slender 'arrowhead' markings.

Small black-and-orange/red butterflies; uppersides are black with varying degrees of red/orange spots and blotches. Undersides are beautifully camouflaged against their habitat; intricate patterns of black or dark grey on a white or pale grey ground, with submarginal spots in varying shades of red to orange, yellow or white. There are some similar species to Amakosa Rocksitter; Natal Rocksitter [i]Durbania limbata[/i] upperside has outer half of hind wing [i]broad[/i] red; sexes similar and flies in late summer to autumn, not spring and early summer. And Clark's Rocksitter [i]D. clarki[/i] is much smaller and its range does not overlap with that of [i]D. amakosa[/i].
 
Sexually dimorphic. [i]D. a. albescens[/i] has extensive white irroration on the forewing upperside apex, and the hind wing underside has no coloured spots, only white where other subspecies have red, yellow or orange. Females have [i]narrow[/i] pale orange upperside bands.
 
7 subspp., geographically distinct.
 
Rocksitters, as their name suggests, like to sit on rocks; they do this for long periods with wings closed, their cryptic undersides hiding them well against lichen growing on the rock. Occasionally one will take off and patrol the area searching for mates. The flight is weak and fluttering, and they have trouble with headwinds, so they keep low, in the boundary layer. They lack a proboscis and cannot feed as adults, so they are never seen on flowers.

Back to Top
Identification
Large, dark Charaxes. In certain parts of its range, males can be confused with Blue-Spotted Charaxes, [i]Charaxes cithaeron cithaeron[/i]. However, that species has [i]much broader[/i] hind wing upperside pale patch, almost totally white. The postdiscal series of forewing royal blue marks are [i]smaller[/i] in [i]C. xiphares[/i]. Females are distinctive. [i]C. x. penningtoni[/i] male is distinguished by blue spot in area M3, which is longer than either neighbouring race [i]C. x. draconis[/i] or [i]C. x. thyestes[/i]. The female has particularly [i]large, clear white[/i] forewing discal spots. The normal female form has a yellow hind wing upperside discal patch; in rare f. [i]luminosa[/i] it is lavender-blue.
 
Sexes strongly dimorphic, male with [i]royal blue[/i] spots and bands on metallic navy ground, female with [i]white discal forewing band[/i] (of variable width) sometimes invaded by yellow-ochre. Most females have a pale yellow hind wing upperside patch, but in some populations, it is blue-white or pale mauve. Differences between females is usually of more value than subtle differences between the males in distinguishing subspecies.
 
Powerful, high flight in the canopy and around tree tops. Males territorial, perching high up and pursuing any butterfly (or other flying creature) that ventures nearby. Females fly rapidly along the fringes of forests where they settle on tree leaves. In [i]C. x. penningtoni[/i], the females are much commoner than males, possibly due to a male-killing pathogen. In its haunts the females adopt the same tree-topping habits as males.
 
Both sexes are attracted to rotting fruit, animal dung and sap leaking from wounded trees.

Medium–small white Pierid with orange wing tips and varying degree of black wing

in basal dark edge of orange tip[/i]; paler orange wing tip colour. Neither species has a
[i]white-edged dark diagonal stripe[/i] running from base to middle of the hind wing underside margin at M3. Differs from Red Tip [i]C. antevippe gavisa[/i] in the [i]distinct orange[/i] colour of the forewing tips, and both sexes [i]lacking black spot at end of cell[/i] on upperside of forewing.
 
Sexually dimorphic. Male upperside resembles small Red Tip [i]Colotis antevippe gavisa; has paler, pure orange forewing tips[/i]; female with distal edge of forewing basal patch on both surfaces forming [i]three square blocks[/i]. Female orange forewing tip [i]crossed by dark stripe[/i].
 
Fast, low flight. Both sexes fly at random, often seen on flowers.
 
Seasonally polymorphic. There are many forms of both sexes, varying according to the seasons. There are many intermediates and the forms shown here only approximate the 'type' for each; the variation is gradual and no two individuals are exactly alike.
 
Wet season male nominate f. [i]evenina[/i] is similarly marked to Red Tip, except for [i]orange colour of forewing tip[/i]. Underside hind wing white to yellow, faint diagonal stripe and orange patches in extreme wet season form; veining [i]never dark[/i]. Female often [i]heavily marked in black[/i], to the point where she is a black butterfly with white bands and a [i]orange tip largely obscured by black[/i]. More lightly marked specimens have less black in the orange tip but still have heavy black stripes across the white areas. Underside may have [i]extensive orange bands[/i] corresponding to upperside black bands. (A) Male upperside. (B) Male underside.(C) Female upperside. (D) Female underside.
 
Dry season male f. [i]deidamioides[/i] lacks dark scaling and basal edge to orange forewing upperside tip.

Identification
Very small butterfly with patterns of orange or orange-red and black on the upperside;
 has a greater or lesser amount of black in the centre of the forewing depending on sex and
subspecies. Underside irrorated with black, grey and white with tiny submarginal spots on
the hind wing. The other Rocksitters that fly in the same areas are Boland Rocksitter
[i]Durbaniopsis saga[/i] and two of the races of Amakosa Rocksitter, [i]Durbania amakosa
amakosa[/i] and [i]D. a. penningtoni[/i]. [i]Durbaniella clarki[/i] is generally smaller
than either, although small males of [i]D. saga[/i] can be in the same size range. It can
immediately be distinguished from that species by the underside; [i]D. clarki[/i] lacks
the [i]conspicuous dark and light bands[/i] of [i]D. saga[/i]. Compared to [i]D.
amakosa[/i], the differences are sex-related. Females of [i]D. amakosa[/i] are always much
larger and have more extensive, better defined patterns of orange or orange-red and black
on the upperside. [i]D. a. amakosa[/i] males have [i]discrete[/i] orange-red spots on the
upperside. [i]D. a. penningtoni[/i] males have very similar upperside markings to [i]D.
clarki[/i] but they are more of a [i]yellow-buff[/i] colour and the hind wing base is
[i]dark[/i].
 
Variable degree of sexual dimorphism depending on subspecies.
 
[i]D. c. phaea[/i] is a dark subspecies; upperside apical pale spots [i]reduced or absent[/i]; male forewing postdiscal band broken into spots. Upperside colouration varies from dull orange-buff to brick red; discal black patch extensive in both sexes.
 
4 subspp., geographically distinct; varying in markings and colour.
 
Rocksitters, as their name suggests, like to sit on rocks; they do this for long periods with wings closed, their cryptic undersides hiding them well against lichen growing on the rock. Occasionally one will take off and patrol the area searching for mates. The flight is weak and fluttering, and they have trouble with headwinds, so they keep low, in the boundary layer. They lack a proboscis and cannot feed as adults, so they are never seen on flowers.

Identification
Medium-sized brown butterfly with orange bands. It has two seasonal forms, which are different in wing shape. Both forms have a brown upperside ground colour with a broad orange median to postdiscal band. Wet season (summer) form lacks the long, hooked forewing apex of the dry season (winter) form, and has shorter hind wing tails. In its habitat the only butterfly likely to be confused with it is Soldier Pansy [i]Junonia terea elgiva[/i], but that is generally [i]smaller[/i] and the orange bands [i]lack[/i] the small interneural spots that are always present in [i]P. tugela[/i]. One of the finest dead-leaf mimics; no two undersides are ever exactly alike.
 
Sexes similar, female larger with broader wings and less dramatically hooked wing tips.
 
Wet season form f. [i]aurorina[/i] smaller than nominate dry season form f. [i]tugela[/i], with both sexes' wing tips [i]less prominently hooked[/i].
 
Flies along lanes and edges of clearings in deep forest. Short glides interspersed with bursts of rapid wingbeats. Flies away rapidly if disturbed; males strongly territorial, sitting on prominent point, chasing away intruders. and if chased away, usually returning to where first seen. Very wary; heads for the canopy when disturbed.

One of the larger sapphires; upperside [i]intense metallic blue[/i] with broad black margins and [i]shiny white[/i] underside, and conspicuous red lunules at the hind wing anal angle. Underside hind wing crossed by submarginal [i]thin red line[/i] that is usually, but not always, curved toward the body. In Straight-line Sapphire [i]I. silarus silarus[/i], the line is (usually) straight and in Trimen's Sapphire [i]I. trimeni[/i] it is [i]black[/i] and usually [i]jagged[/i]. The upperside black margins of [i]I. trimeni[/i] and [i]I' silarus silarus[/i] are narrower (especially on the hind wing).
 
Sexes differ slightly; female duller blue than male, [i]very broad[/i] hind wing upperside red to orange marginal band, stretching to area M1, compared to [i]I. silarus silarus[/i] and [i]I. trimeni[/i], in which it is narrower and confined to the anal angle, as it is in male [i]I. silas[/i] or both sexes of [i]I. silarus silarus[/i] or [i]I. trimeni[/i]. Distal part of forewing upperside blue patch [i]suffused with white[/i] to a greater or lesser degree, more so than in [i]I. silarus silarus[/i], whose females are often free from white in the upperside blue. Male has conspicuous [i]sex brand[/i] at hind wing upperside costa.
 
Males perch atop tall trees during midday hours, preferring those with glossy leaves against which their white underside is not easy to spot. But the white and blue combination is conspicuous in flight. Females are found closer to host plant, and nectaring at low flowers.

Identification
A distinctive but very variable small Bitter Acraea. Forms [i]protea[/i] and [i]monteironis[/i] may be mistaken for Common Wanderer [i]Acraea aganice[/i] but that species is [i]larger[/i] and [i]lacks[/i] the pale patch on the inner margin of the forewing.
 
There is slight sexual dimorphism, depending on form. F. [i]esebria[/i] has rich tawny orange basal patches, subapical pale patch ochre in male, white in female. In both sexes of f. [i]ertli[/i], similar to f. [i]esebria[/i], the white apical patches are broader and white, and the forewing submarginal patch is a paler tawny orange than the hind wing.
 
Both sexes of f. [i]jacksoni[/i] have all pale markings pale tawny orange. F. [i]swynnertoni[/i] resembles f. [i]jacksoni[/i] but the apical patch is white. These forms are rare and normally only found in Zimbabwe. F. [i]protea[/i] male (common in South Africa) has ochreous cream forewing patches; female has subapical patch white. In f. [i]monteironis[/i] (both sexes), the patches are all white.
 
The undersides are generally similar in colour to the uppersides; some examples are shown here.
 
Flight slow, easy to approach. Common along forest paths and edges of clearings.
 
As the colour of the underside pale markings tends to follow that of the upperside, not all the undersides are illustrated.

Identification
A medium-sized butterfly, this is one of three 'Admirals' having a black upperside ground colour, orange postdiscal transverse forewing band and hind wing marginal band, and hind wing tails. Compared to Southern Short-tailed Admiral [i]Vanessa hippomene hippomene[/i] and Northern Short-tailed Admiral [i]V. dimorphica dimorphica[/i], it is larger and has [i]longer tails[/i]. The hind wing underside markings are also different. The ground colour is a redder shade of brown and the pale markings are [i]blue[/i] as opposed to white.
 
Sexes similar.
 
Flight fast, typical nymphaline short glides interspersed with bursts of rapid wingbeats. Males occupy territories on forest edges and along paths and streams, and perch quite high up (>3m), sallying forth to challenge any other insect invading their domain. May also be found on the ground drinking from wet mud or on animal dung. Shy and wary; if disturbed, will hide in undergrowth or take off into the canopy. Occasionally found in large numbers. Attracted to traps baited with fermenting fruit.

One of the larger [i]Virachola[/i] Playboys. The male is distinctive with his bright orange hind wing upperside and black forewing carrying an orange band at the inner margin. The black is shot with purple which is only visible at very acute angles. The species closest to this one is Black-and-orange Playboy, [i]Virachola dariaves[/i], which lacks the strong orange forewing bar.
 
Underside of both sexes is grey, varying in shade from cool to warm; there are submarginal and postdiscal rows of darker grey and white lines that are 'cut' into segments by the wing veins, and a single darker grey and white mark at the end of the cell in both wings. Unlike other South African [i]Virachola[/i] Playboys there are NO dark basal spots on the underside of either wing. Both sexes have a single white-tipped tail at the hind wing anal angle.
 
Sexes differ on the upperside. The female is brown with large discal patches of [i]dove-grey[/i] and not [i]pale-blue[/i] as in [i]V. antalus[/i] or [i]V. dinomenes[/i]; female [i]V. dariaves[/i] is more [i]blackish[/i] and [i]V. dinochares[/i] has smaller pale discal patches; [i]V. vansoni[/i] females are smaller.
 
Males perch on prominent twigs and leaves on forest edges; conspicuous when chasing other butterflies; usually returns to same perch. Females are found on flowers and close to the host plant.

Identification
Small black-and-orange/red butterflies; uppersides are black with varying degrees of red/orange spots and blotches. Undersides are beautifully camouflaged against their habitat; intricate patterns of black or dark grey on a white or pale grey ground, with submarginal spots in varying shades of red to orange, yellow or white. There are some similar species to Amakosa Rocksitter; Natal Rocksitter [i]Durbania limbata[/i] upperside has outer half of hind wing [i]broad[/i] red; sexes similar and flies in late summer to autumn, not spring and early summer. And Clark's Rocksitter [i]D. clarki[/i] is much smaller and its range does not overlap with that of [i]D. amakosa[/i].
 
Sexually dimorphic. [i]D. a. sagittata[/i] is similar to [i]D. a. ayresi[/i] and [i]D. a. natalensis[/i] but the underside is more [i]yellowish[/i] than other subspecies. The male hind wing upperside orange patch is serrated at the distal edge due to the orange colour being extended along the veins.
 
7 subspp., geographically distinct.
 
Rocksitters, as their name suggests, like to sit on rocks; they do this for long periods with wings closed, their cryptic undersides hiding them well against lichen growing on the rock. Occasionally one will take off and patrol the area searching for mates. The flight is weak and fluttering, and they have trouble with headwinds, so they keep low, in the boundary layer. They lack a proboscis and cannot feed as adults, so they are never seen on flowers.

Forewing underside has typical 'Copper' pattern of black spots on a pale ground with dark borders. Hind wing underside variable depending on subspecies; pale buff to almost black, darker spots vary from indistinct to streaky marbling of russet brown with brassy sagittate streaks.
 
[i]C. pan henningi[/i] is larger and more strikingly marked on upperside than nominate; male basal blue [i]brighter, more extensive[/i]. Underside hind wing varies from weakly marked, as in nominate, to strongly variegated in brown and tan with red streaks and silvery sagittate postdiscal marks. Sexes similar. Female upperside [i]lacks[/i] opal sheen, basal blue [i]restricted[/i] to basal 25% of wings.
 
3 subspp., geographically distinct. Low flight, usually not as fast as other Opals. Habits more colonial than [i]C. thysbe[/i], and more likely to be found in gullies and riverbeds than on hill and dune tops. Males perch on prominent rocks and bushes, chasing intruders away.

Sexually dimorphic in that the female is never greenish white like the male, and always has [i]dark marks[/i] along the upperside margins, but not to the same extent as females of Cambridge Vagrant [i]N. Thalassina[/i]. There are several female forms. Wet season form females are larger, marginal upperside dark spots larger, hind wing upperside [i]white[/i]. Variable extent of basal orange-red on upperside forewing. Dry season form females are smaller, hind wing upperside varies from white, to patches of orange-yellow, to yellow and deep yellow-orange. Yellow hind wing forms rare at coast. F. [i]aurora[/i] most typical female form.
 
2 subspp., geographically distinct. Flight fast and direct, stopping seldom, unless at flowers (usually orange or red, but they are fond of [i]Plumbago[/i]) to nectar. Any bright red object will attract them.

Identification
This is the familiar little white butterfly that migrates across the country in vast numbers almost every year. Upperside similar to Meadow White [i]Pontia helice helice[/i], but can be told apart by the forewing cellular spot, which is bar- or dumbbell-shaped. Forewing upperside pattern similar to other [i]Belenois[/i] species such as Forest White [i]B. zochalia zochalia[/i], and African Veined White [i]B. gidica[/i] that have [i]dumbbell-shaped[/i] bars at the distal end of the cell. It differs from the Forest White in the [i]lack of pearlescence in the white[/i], and from African Veined White in that it is [i]smaller[/i]. The hind wing underside [i]does not have a postdiscal row of sagittate dark marks[/i]; the veins are [i]clearly delineated[/i] in grey-brown, without the 'streaky' interneural marks. Unlike the Meadow White, the underside dark marks are [i]not a mix of black and yellow scales[/i], and there may be yellow marks but they do not invade the dark areas. Also, females never have yellow wings, as do both the similar [i]Belenois[/i] species.
 
Sexes similar, female dark markings [i]brown, black[/i] in male. Female with dark marginal borders much broader than male, containing [i]no white marks[/i], dumbbell-shaped dark mark at distal end of forewing upperside cell larger, merges with costal stripe. There are no clear seasonal forms; dry season specimens tend to have [i]reduced dark markings[/i].
 
Flight medium fast, direct, stopping often to feed on flowers. Males are fond of congregating on wet mud. Often found close to the host plants.

One of a large group of [i]Chrysoritis[/i] Opals with [i]blue wing bases[/i] and a [i]shimmering, electric opalescent sheen[/i] over a varying area of the wings. For [i]Chrysoritis thysbe[/i], amount of blue on upperside varies, in some subspecies almost covering the forewing. Forewing underside has typical 'Copper' pattern of black spots on a pale ground with dark borders. Hind wing underside varies from plain sandy tan to dark brown, to [i]variegated[/i] with striae in various shades of reddish-brown, with bands of paler colouring and brassy postdiscal streaks. 'Plain' underside specimens usually have unicoloured cilia; 'variegated' ones dark cilia with pale interneural flecks, appearing 'chequered'.
 
[i]C. t. whitei[/i] has upperside solid blue paler than in [i]C. thysbe thysbe[/i] or [i]C. thysbe mithras[/i] and seldom extends beyond the forewing cell spot. Cilia orange with small pale interneural spots and black vein ends, giving dentate appearance to wing edges. Hind wing underside is variegated in dark brown and cream, with silvery white streaks. Sexes differ. Female has [i]rounder wings[/i], upperside blue [i]restricted to basal 25% of wings[/i], no opalescent sheen. The females of the various races are almost impossible to separate on wing patterns and identification usually requires comparison with males seen at the same locality.
 
7 subspp., not always geographically distinct. Rapid, sustained flight, settling on prominent bushes or rocks. Male intensively territorial on hill tops or sand dunes, regularly patrolling and chasing intruders; Females are found more at random, often on flowers.

Identification
Medium to large butterfly, with weak but sustained fluttering flight, sometimes sailing, at medium height, 2–3m above the ground. Usually found flying alone or in small groups, but may be found in large numbers on wounded plants exuding pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Fond of nectar. This butterfly has complex biogeography; it is widespread across Asia, southern Europe and the whole of Africa. Several variants occur across this range, the relationship between these is the subject of several studies.
 
A form resembling [i]Danaus chrysippus dorippus[/i], the common subspecies in the arid northern and eastern side of Africa, is the rarest in South Africa. The wing tip is orange, lacking the white-spotted black pattern. Typical [i]D. c. dorippus[/i] has the orange spreading all the way from the wing bases; form [i]klugii[/i] has chocolate-brown basal suffusion and form [i]transiens[/i] is similar to [i]klugii[/i] but in addition has traces of the white forewing spots seen in [i]D. c. orientis[/i] and [i]D. c. alcippus[/i].
 
Further north in Africa, all the forms of [i]D. c. dorippus[/i] may be found with the white hind wing patch of [i]D. c. alcippus[/i], but these are not found in SA.
 
It is possible that the appearance of forms resembling [i]D. c. dorippus[/i] among the South African [i]D. c. orientis[/i] population is a result of edge-of-range interbreeding with those races when climatic conditions make this possible.
 
(E) Male upperside (f. [i]dorippus[/i]). (F) Female upperside (f. [i]klugii[/i]). (G) Female underside (close to f. [i]transiens[/i]). Undersides of (E) and (F) resemble that of (G). Upperside of (G) resembles that of (F) but has the white spots in the forewing apex.

Female 34–36mm.
Back to Top
Identification
Small buff butterfly. Pale buff with [i]no[/i] markings on either wing surface. Similar wing shape and size to Millar's Buff, [i]Deloneura millari[/i]. Nothing else is known about this species.
 
Three were taken near Fort Bowker in December 1863 by Col. JH Bowker. Two were females and these are usually figured as here; Trimen stated a male to have been taken but its whereabouts are uncertain. The forests near the putative type locality have largely been destroyed so it is unlikely this butterfly will be rediscovered. However, lepidopterists still search, hopefully, for it.
 
Habits unrecorded but likely to be similar to other [i]Deloneura[/i] Buffs; shy and retiring habits, slow flight with rapid wingbeats, but making little progress. They gather in groups of several specimens, feeding on honeydew secreted by scale insects quite high in the canopy, 3 to 6metres up. The butterflies walk slowly around these insects, their camouflaged undersides making them almost impossible to spot. They hardly ever fly unless deliberately flushed, and the best way to see them is to patiently tap the foliage of suitable trees in the habitat. If a group is disturbed they will fly out, with peculiar fast flapping wingbeats. Although the flight is slow, if chased they can put on a respectable turn of speed.

Large, bright blue [i]Lepidochrysops[/i] Ant Blue. Upperside [i]pale, pearlescent mauve-blue[/i]; underside ground colour of both sexes warm fawn-grey, with well-defined rows of white-edged, darker grey spots and basal hind wing black spots. Underside similar to Rossouw's [i]Lepidochrysops rossouwi[/i] and Silvery [i]L. glauca[/i] Blues, but upperside of both sexes is a deeper, more violaceous blue. Both surfaces of both sexes' hind wings have [i]prominent[/i] orange lunules above large black spots at the anal angle. The largest spot is in area CuA1; sometimes the black spot in area 1A+2A is absent but the orange lunule still present. Hind wing carries a small tail at end of vein CuA2. Cilia plain whitish grey.
 
The shade of upperside blue is somewhat variable. Specimens from arid areas tend to be a paler shade of mauve-blue but are never ice-blue as in [i]L. glauca[/i].
 
Sexually dimorphic; male upperside plain blue with [i]thin fuscous-grey margins[/i]. Female upperside has variable extent of basal and discal [i]mauve-blue[/i] on a [i]fuscous-grey[/i] ground, [i]whitish[/i] sagittate hind wing submarginal marks. Female also has [i]larger dark spot at the distal end of the cell[/i] than the male, and in some specimens there is a postdiscal row of faint white-edged grey spots corresponding in position to those on the underside.
 
Most males fly rapidly, erratically and randomly over Grassland or bushveld, colonies not concentrated, males congregating near prominent trees. Where the larval host plant is [i]Salvia[/i], they exhibit more colonial behaviour, and are found at high density in relatively small areas.

Underside olive-green; [i]five small white discal spots[/i] on hind wing in areas CuA1 to Rs. Cilia plain pale grey-brown. Similar to some of the [i]Borbo[/i] Swifts that have yellow or green hairs on the upperside. Rusty Swift [i]Borbo detecta[/i] has distinctly [i]reddish yellow ochre[/i] hairs. Olive-haired Swift [i]B. borbonica[/i] has olive-green hairs but the hind wing underside black-ringed white spots are distinctive. Twin Swift [i]Larsenia gemella[/i] has yellowish to greenish ochre hairs, but has [i]only three[/i] hind wing underside discal spots.
 
Sexually dimorphic. Male has [i]white[/i] forewing discal sex brand diagonally crossing CuA2. Female [i]lacks sex brand[/i]; larger than male, wings more elongated, forewing upperside has [i]hyaline discal spot[/i] in CuA2, [i]white spot[/i] in CuA1. Apart from the different colour of the male sex brand, the number of discal hind wing underside spots distinguishes this species from the very similar Black-branded Swift [i]Pelopidas mathias mathias[/i].
 
Males are territorial on hilltops, at edges of forest, along roads, paths or streams, chasing intruding males. Flight rapid, but settling often on low shrubs, grass stems or rocks; fairly easy to approach. Females are more sedentary, around flowers.

Identification
Medium-sized bright orange butterfly with dark bands and spots on upperside. Could be mistaken on the wing for one of the Jokers [i]Byblia[/i] spp., or Gaudy Commodore [i]Precis octavia sesamus[/i] f. [i]natalensis[/i]. Distinguished by [i]deep violet-blue sheen[/i] over upperside, and [i]row of blue spots[/i] in [i]broad, black[/i] submarginal band on hind wing upperside. A 'hairy' butterfly with [i]long, untidy[/i] cilia edging the wings. The [i]plain[/i], buff to brown underside is also distinctive.
 
Sexes similar.
 
Flies low with short glides interspersed with bursts of rapid wingbeats. Flies away rapidly if disturbed; males strongly territorial, sitting on prominent patch of bare earth, chasing away intruders. and if chased away, usually return to where first seen. They are often seen close to streams and springs. One of the earliest Highveld butterflies seen in spring.
 
Dry season form f. [i]obscurior[/i] has a [i]dark[/i] ground colour and [i]chocolate-brown[/i] underside; nominate wet season form has [i]golden brown[/i] underside, with more conspicuous submarginal eye spots.

One of the larger 'whites'. Plain upperside, and usually plain underside. Pointed forewing tips and rounded hind wings; dark forewing upperside margin, if present, is [i]narrow[/i], unlike similar Buquet's Vagrant [i]Nepheronia buquetii[/i]. Eyes never [i]bright green[/i] as in that species, and hind wing underside discal spot, if present, is [i]pale[/i], not brown.
 
The male has only one form, the pale blue-green nominate. Females have three forms; the bright yellow nominate, pale yellow f. [i]hyblaea[/i] and male-like f. [i]pyrene[/i].
 
Flight sustained and powerful, covering large distances, restless and seldom settling for long in the same place. Migrating swarms may occur with many millions of individuals all flying in the same direction. Thousands may be seen drinking from mud puddles in hot weather, and both sexes are often seen nectaring at flowers. They show a distinct preference for red and orange blooms. In the dry season, they may be found hibernating between the leaves of bushes and creepers. The yellow nominate females show are often found resting among yellowed leaves.

The underside hind wing has little to no orange-tawny colour in the submarginal band.
 
Sexes similar, but male has [i]narrower, more triangular[/i] wings.
 
Although this is a small Charaxes it lacks nothing in speed of flight or, in the male, pugnacity. Males form territories on hilltops, or in flat country, around prominent bushes and trees. They pursue any butterfly (or other flying creature) that ventures nearby. Females are found close to the host plants, or wandering around searching for males.
 
Both sexes are attracted to rotting fruit, animal dung and sap leaking from wounded trees.

Dull blue and brown 'blue'. Upperside dull violaceous blue with fuscous-brown margins. Dark hind wing upperside anal lunule [i]faint or absent[/i]. No forewing upperside cell spot. Underside of both sexes pale, warm shade of brownish-grey; postmedian series of black spots in forewing are [i]circular to slightly oval[/i], thinly outlined in white; small spots on edges of discal area of hind wing, and [i]indistinct[/i] pale hind wing postdiscal band running parallel to outer margin. Distal to this is a series of darker grey sagittate marks. Has a very small black anal spot in area CuA1, with some metallic blue scaling and a small orange lunule. This distinguishes it from Brinkman's Blue [i]Orachrysops brinkmani[/i], in which this spot is [i]always absent[/i]. Cilia plain brownish grey. Size variable, autumn brood often has dwarfs.
 
Sexually dimorphic. Male upperside dull violet-blue, marginal borders [i]broad, grey-brown[/i]. Female marginal borders much wider, blue variable in extent, tending to be brighter, [i]less violet[/i] than male.
 
Flight erratic, fairly slow and close to the ground, but fast if disturbed. Males patrol a 'beat' along a contour or line of taller bushes in the fynbos, setting occasionally but wary and difficult to approach. Females are more sedentary, found on flowers or close to the host plants; may sit sunning themselves wings open during sunny intervals on cloudy days.

Records exist from lowland wooded areas of KwaZulu-Natal (Hluhluwe/False Bay area to Kosi Bay and further north, inland to Makhathini Flats). The map shows where suitable habitat exists, but it is based on historical records and there has been much confusion between this species and Purple-brown Hairstreak, so it may show a wider distribution than actually exists. Current opinion has it that they are only found in the vicinity of False Bay and along the coast to the north. The species requires more study.

Sexes very similar. Female larger than male with broader wings and a larger abdomen.
 
Rocksitters, as their name suggests, like to sit on rocks; they do this for long periods with wings closed, their cryptic undersides hiding them well against lichen growing on the rock. Occasionally one will take off and patrol the area searching for mates. The flight is weak and fluttering, and they have trouble with headwinds, so they keep low, in the boundary layer. They lack a proboscis and cannot feed as adults, so they are never seen on flowers.

Male 26–39mm female 29–40mm.
Back to Top
Identification
Small to very small Rocksitter. Upperside brown, markings [i]dull cream[/i] or [i]buff[/i]. Underside is [i]more variegated[/i] than other Rocksitters, marbled grey, brown and black colouration forming [i]distinct bands[/i], which sets it apart from the other Rocksitter that flies in the same areas, Clark's Rocksitter [i]Durbaniella clarki[/i]. Like other Rocksitters, the underside resembles lichen on rock, and provides camouflage.
 
Sexes similar; females usually much larger than males and [i]paler[/i] on the upperside, with [i]pale basal suffusion[/i] on all wings.
 
Rocksitters, as their name suggests, like to sit on rocks; they do this for long periods with wings closed, their cryptic undersides hiding them well against lichen growing on the rock. Occasionally one will take off and patrol the area searching for mates. The flight is weak and fluttering, and they have trouble with headwinds, so they keep low, in the boundary layer. They lack a proboscis and cannot feed as adults, so they are never seen on flowers.

Male 20–24mm female 22–25mm.
Back to Top
Identification
Tiny lycaenid; when examined close up the only species that can be confused with it is Brilliant Gem, [i]Chloroselas pseudozeritis pseudozeritis[/i]. Apart from the differences in the male uppersides, the undersides of both sexes can be told apart by the [i]pale, grey-buff[/i] colour of Purple Gem, carrying [i]smaller, less well-defined[/i] brassy centred spots. Each hind wing carries a pair of thin tails with white tips at the anal angle.
 
Sexually dimorphic. The male upperside has a [i]deep purple sheen[/i] over a dark brown ground colour. This is less metallic than the blue-green of Brilliant Gem, but as in that species, the colour is only visible when viewed under light coming from the correct acute angle. Female is plain [i]dull-brown[/i] above, [i]lacking the buff or blue scaling[/i] of Brilliant Gem.
 
Habits similar to Bars, High-fliers and Scarlets but small size and rapid flight makes them difficult to spot amongst the hordes of tiny Babul Blues ([i]Azanus[/i] sp.) and Hairtails ([i]Anthene[/i] sp.) with which they habitually fly. Occasionally in strong colonies, but more often found singly.

Small coppery Opal. Upperside [i]bright coppery-orange[/i] with black marginal borders and [i]sparse[/i] black forewing spots; largest of which is at the distal end of the cell. Similar to many other Opals with plain copper uppersides but most are not found in the same areas. May be confused with Lydenburg Opal [i]Chrysoritis aethon[/i], but [i]smaller[/i], shade of orange ground colour [i]less shiny and red, fewer[/i] black spots on forewing, [i]none[/i] on hind wing. Also resembles Tsomo River Opal [i]C. lyncurium[/i], but hind wing upperside costa [i]less heavily marked with black[/i]. Another species that flies in the same areas is Burnished Opal [i]C. chrysaor[/i], but that species has a curved line of black discal spots on the hind wing. Underside forewing has typical 'Copper' pattern of black spots on a pale ground with dark borders. Underside hind wing is [i]red-brown to greenish-buff[/i] crossed by lines of darker brown.
 
Sexes similar, female paler orange; not as metallic as the male. Forewing outer margin [i]more rounded[/i]. Underside hind wing in female usually has a [i]more greenish[/i] tinge.
 
Colonies found close to host plants. Male perches on low vegetation, chasing other butterflies. Female more sedentary, usually on flowers.

There are some similar species to Amakosa Rocksitter; Natal Rocksitter [i]Durbania limbata[/i] upperside has outer half of hind wing [i]broad[/i] red; sexes similar and flies in late summer to autumn, not spring and early summer. And Clark's Rocksitter [i]D. clarki[/i] is much smaller and its range does not overlap with that of [i]D. amakosa[/i].
 
Sexually dimorphic. [i]D. a. flavida[/i] is similar to [i]D. a. natalensis[/i] but the upperside markings are [i]more yellowish[/i] The underside hind wing submarginal spots are [i]yellow-orange[/i], not red.

Distinctive small butterfly with brown upperside crossed by orange or buff bands, and unmistakable [i]long palpi[/i] forming a 'snout', hence the common name. Underside very variable, from blackish through wide range of browns and greys to buff, and mottled with varying numbers of darker markings. Specimens flying in the wet season have heavier underside patterning than dry season individuals. Its tendency to swarm, small size and brown colouration makes it similar to the Tree Nymphs [i]Sevenia[/i] spp, but the long 'snout' tells it apart, as well as the upperside patterning.
 
Sexes similar, female with broader wings.
 
Weak, flitting flight, settling often and sitting very still, protected from attack by its excellent camouflage. Frequents forest canopy, flying lower to sit on tree branches and wet mud, where it is wary and difficult to approach, flitting off to sit a few metres away. Occasionally encountered in migrating swarms.

Flight fast, typical nymphaline short glides interspersed with bursts of rapid wingbeats. Males occupy territories on forest edges and along paths and streams, and perch two or three metres up, sallying forth to challenge any other insect invading their domain. May also be found on the ground drinking from wet mud or on animal dung. Shy and wary; if disturbed, will hide in undergrowth or take off into the canopy. Occasionally found in large numbers.

Sexes similar. Females occasionally show upperside very dark brown markings on both wings; underside, which is often paler, less well marked than that of the male. Male has grey-brown tridentate sex brand, restricted to origin of veins M3, CuA1 and CuA2. This is conspicuous against the dark grey-brown ground colour.

Identification
Very small butterfly with patterns of orange or orange-red and black on the upperside;
 has a greater or lesser amount of black in the centre of the forewing depending on sex and
subspecies. Underside irrorated with black, grey and white with tiny submarginal spots on
the hind wing. The other Rocksitters that fly in the same areas are Boland Rocksitter
[i]Durbaniopsis saga[/i] and two of the races of Amakosa Rocksitter, [i]Durbania amakosa
amakosa[/i] and [i]D. a. penningtoni[/i]. [i]Durbaniella clarki[/i] is generally smaller
than either, although small males of [i]D. saga[/i] can be in the same size range. It can
immediately be distinguished from that species by the underside; [i]D. clarki[/i] lacks
the [i]conspicuous dark and light bands[/i] of [i]D. saga[/i]. Compared to [i]D.
amakosa[/i], the differences are sex-related. Females of [i]D. amakosa[/i] are always much
larger and have more extensive, better defined patterns of orange or orange-red and black
on the upperside. [i]D. a. amakosa[/i] males have [i]discrete[/i] orange-red spots on the
upperside. [i]D. a. penningtoni[/i] males have very similar upperside markings to [i]D.
clarki[/i] but they are more of a [i]yellow-buff[/i] colour and the hind wing base is
[i]dark[/i].
 
Variable degree of sexual dimorphism depending on subspecies. [i]D. c. jenniferae[/i] upperside orange lighter and more extensive than in [i]D. c. clarki[/i] or [i]D. c. phaea[/i], but not to the same extent as in [i]D. c. belladonna[/i]. In the male, the forewing postdiscal orange spots are [i]arrowhead-shaped[/i], especially those near the anal angle. The forewing discal dark patch is [i]reduced but always present[/i] in both sexes.
 
4 subspp., geographically distinct; varying in markings and colour.

Identification
Medium to large sized Charaxes. Male could be confused with White-barred Charaxes, [i]Charaxes brutus natalensis[/i], but underside very different and not found in same habitats. Female upperside similar to that of Blue-spangled Charaxes, [i]C. guderiana guderiana[/i], or Foxy Charaxes [i]C. saturnus saturnus[/i], but again, the undersides are different.
 
Sexes differ in upperside colouration; male has pure white markings on black ground. Female colouring resembles Foxy Emperor, but median band broken into individual blotches. Both have upperside discal bands and marginal spots in similar pattern to Foxy Emperor. Underside of both sexes similar to Scarce Forest Emperor [i]C. etesipe tavetensis[/i], but with [i]grey[/i], not white, flash on hind wing costa.
 
Fast, agile flight; males are very territorial, hilltopping and perching on prominent twigs on bushes, and pursuing any butterfly (or other flying creature) that ventures nearby. Females fly lower down, around clumps of bush, settling on leaves.
 
Both sexes are attracted to rotting fruit, animal dung and sap leaking from wounded trees. More-or-less restricted to wooded Savanna and forest.

It is closely mimicked by the False Wanderer [i]Pseudacraea eurytus imitator[/i], even to the extent of having the same sexual dimorphism and high flight. They can be told apart by the black spots at the base of the underside wings. The 'true' Wanderer only has them on the hind wing. [i]P. eurytus imitator[/i] has them on both wings.
 
Sexually dimorphic; male with wings narrower than female, and [i]yellow[/i] instead of white wing markings.
 
Male strongly territorial; settles high-up, chases off settling intruders. Female fond
of flowers, often found near host plants. Their flight pattern is more 'fluttering' than
flat-winged soaring as in [i]P. eurytus imitator[/i].

Identification
Very small, dark Skipper with black-and-white chequered upperside and forewing underside. One of a group of very similar little butterflies, which are difficult to tell apart from the upperside markings. To be reasonably sure of identification a clear view of the hind wing underside is necessary. Forewing upperside central cell spot [i]closer to discocellular spot[/i] than basal spot, which sets it apart from other [i]Spialia[/i] species with three cell spots, except Grassveld Sandman [i]S. agylla[/i]. Underside hind wing pale median band [i]jagged-edged but complete[/i]. Runs parallel to series of pale basal spots, creating two jagged, black-edged ochreous-brown bands. Cilia chequered. Differs from Grassveld Sandman, whose median band is [i]much more irregular[/i], a series of white spots that may or may not be joined. The part of the band in the cell connects via a dark edged white line to a submarginal spot in area M2. In this respect it resembles the much smaller Mite Sandman [i]S. paula[/i] but in that butterfly the median band is [i]broken into spots[/i].
 
Sexes similar; females usually larger than males, with [i]larger abdomen[/i].
 
Fast, buzzing, low flight, settling often, wings open. Male hilltops, more often on grassy than wooded hillsides, and patrols the area. Both sexes fond of flowers, seldom on mud. Male often found sitting on the ground, female scarcer, most often near host plants.

Small butterfly, largest of Brauns's Skolly group. Upperside ground colour buff. Both sexes have wings more pointed than Boland Skolly [i]Thestor protumnus[/i] group. Upperside and forewing underside widely bordered with [i]grey-brown[/i] and having [i]conspicuous dark-and-light[/i] chequered cilia. Upperside and forewing underside have [i]heavy black spotting[/i]. Hind wing underside has cryptic pattern of basal, postdiscal and marginal bands of darker scaling on a grey-brown ground. Has a characteristic [i]squarish hind wing underside dark discal mark[/i] containing a hooked pale line.
 
Sexually dimorphic. Male smaller than female and [i]much darker[/i], with shorter, more pointed wings. Male forewing has [i]heavy sex brand[/i] coloured dark brown to grey-brown in basal part of CuA1 and CuA2, spreading along veins M3, CuA1 and CuA2. [i]T. d. malagas[/i] flies very close to the sea in its habitat; male similar bright colour to [i]T. d. warreni[/i] but with reduced dark markings, especially in area 1A+2A. The hind wing underside discal mark is [i]darker and smaller[/i] than the other two subspecies.
 
3 subspp., geographically distinct. The males show more differences than the females.
 
[i]T. dicksoni[/i] lives in large colonies, usually in terrain dotted with low 'bossies' or large rocks. Flight is low, fast and sustained, dodging between rocks and plants. They settle often on low vegetation or rocks, but are wary and difficult to approach. The females fly more slowly than the males.

Back to Top
Identification
Small buff butterfly. Similar to Kaplan's Skolly [i]Thestor kaplani[/i] but with [i]elongated forewings, less convex outer margin, and more pointed forewings[/i]. The male's wing tip black does not invade the discal area to the same extent, so that the typical [i]Thestor[/i] spotting is more visible. Underside hind wing pale grey to brown with indistinct basal band and faint submarginal row of 'V'-shaped marks joined into a line. Has a dark, zigzag median line bent towards the margin between veins M1 and M3.
 
Sexually dimorphic. Male has [i]golden-buff[/i] wing bases and [i]heavy black[/i] wing tips; tridentate sex brand is also golden-buff; restricted to veins M3, CuA1 and CuA2. Underside hind wing pale grey with well-defined median line. Female is a more typical buff [i]Thestor[/i] type, with more pale colouring on wings. Dark bands heavy; shade of buff varies from dull buff to bright orange-buff. Underside hind wing pale brown with fainter median line than male; cf. female [i]T. compassbergae[/i] and [i]T. pringlei[/i].
 
[i]T. camdeboo[/i] lives in colonies, usually on high, north-east facing mountain slopes, on shale covered slopes or grassy areas. Fast, low flight, settling on rocks or low plants. Males form territories in open areas. Difficult to follow in flight; when settled, superbly camouflaged underside hard to spot. Usually found in groups of three or four, but in the right conditions can occur in large numbers.

Identification
The only South African [i]Charaxes[/i] to have named seasonal forms. The male is, with Pearl Charaxes [i]Charaxes varanes varanes[/i], the only South African Charaxes to have only one tail.
 
Sexes similar The male has wings more triangular than female, and [i]only one[/i] spatulate tail (where the female has two tails).
 
Seasonally dimorphic. The whitish wet season form f. [i]zoolina[/i] is unmistakable. In flight, the orange and brown dry season form f. [i]neanthes[/i] is similar to the Pearl-spotted Charaxes [i]C. jahlusa[/i], but its dark markings are [i]red-brown[/i], not black. Occasional specimens with colouring intermediate between the two forms have been recorded.
 
The species may swarm in warmer areas. It is slower-flying than other Charaxes, the males forming territories around a tree or clump of shrubs, and flying around them for hours. Females are most often found near the host plants. Both seasonal forms may fly together.
 
Both sexes are attracted to rotting fruit, animal dung and sap leaking from wounded trees. They are also frequently found nectaring on flowers.

Identification
Small to medium-sized orange butterfly with black bands and spots. One of two species of Joker found in South Africa. Conspicuous, bright orange, small butterfly. Can be told apart from Common Joker [i]Byblia anvatara acheloia[/i] by [i]row of black spots[/i] in hind wing upperside discal band. Underside shows considerable seasonal variation; dry season form [i]badiata[/i] hind wing underside crossed with chocolate-brown bands and yellow-white spots. More common wet season form f. [i]ilithyia[/i] has [i]yellow-ochre[/i] hind wing on underside, basal spots black, submarginal band black with small white spots. Other superficially similar species are Gaudy Commodore [i]Precis octavia sesamus[/i] f. [i]natalensis[/i], and Pirate [i]Catacroptera cloanthe[/i]. The former lacks the [i]pale underside markings[/i] and the latter has a [i]plain[/i] underside.
 
Sexes similar in markings: male [i]much brighter orange[/i] than female, edges of black marks [i]better defined[/i].
 
Active, erratic flight, usually not more than 1–2m above the ground, in open grassy areas and between bushes. Frequently settles on plants but seldom flowers, wings open, slowly 'pumping' them. Like [i]B. anvatara acheloia[/i] and [i]Danaus chrysippus[/i], commonly seen sucking grass flowerheads, behaviour that is not currently understood as grasses do not produce nectar. Both sexes are attracted to fallen fruit and come readily to traps baited with this.

One of a large group of [i]Chrysoritis[/i] Opals with [i]blue wing bases[/i] and a [i]shimmering, electric opalescent sheen[/i] over a varying area of the wings. For [i]Chrysoritis thysbe[/i], amount of blue on upperside varies, in some subspecies almost covering the forewing. Forewing underside has typical 'Copper' pattern of black spots on a pale ground with dark borders. Hind wing underside varies from plain sandy tan to dark brown, to [i]variegated[/i] with striae in various shades of reddish-brown, with bands of paler colouring and brassy postdiscal streaks. 'Plain' underside specimens usually have unicoloured cilia; 'variegated' ones dark cilia with pale interneural flecks, appearing 'chequered'.
 
settling on prominent bushes or rocks. Male intensively territorial on hill tops or sand dunes, regularly patrolling and chasing intruders; Females are found more at random, often on flowers.
 
[i]C. t. psyche[/i] nearly always has the plain underside and unicoloured cilia, with hind wing underside silver streaks [i]absent[/i]. Male upperside has [i]extensive blue, paler[/i] than in [i]C. thysbe bamptoni[/i], also with dark margins. Hind wing upperside has [i]restricted basal blue[/i] and [i]tiny or absent[/i] dark discal spots. Sexes differ. Female has [i]rounder wings[/i], upperside blue [i]restricted to basal 25% of wings[/i], no opalescent sheen. The females of the various races are almost impossible to separate on wing patterns and identification usually requires comparison with males seen at the same locality.

Identification
Medium-sized canopy butterfly, dark with prominent paler markings. Resembles distasteful members of the genus [i]Amauris[/i] but generally so, the resemblance is not exact and the colours do not exactly match.
 
Forewing marks of [i]P. l. tarquinia smaller[/i] than in [i]P. l. expansa[/i]. Pale markings vary from white to pale yellow-ochre.
 
Sexes alike, female with markings identical to male, but with rounder wings.
 
Floating, sailing flight, wings open flat, with infrequent rapid wingbeats. This distinguishes them from the more fluttering flight of the models. If disturbed they can put on a turn of speed. Male territorial, perching on prominent forest-edge leaves, chasing intruders. If chased away he usually returns to the same perch. The female is less active. Both sexes are often seen nectaring on flowering trees. Occasionally found low down, drinking at mud puddles.

Identification
Small butterfly conspicuously [i]buff[/i] upperside and forewing underside, bordered with [i]grey-brown[/i] and having chequered cilia, the amount of contrast varying. Colour varies between subspecies, and within populations can range from bright cartridge-buff to a darker tawny-buff. Upperside and forewing underside carry variable number of dark spots, depending on subspecies and varying within populations. Hind wing underside has cryptic pattern of basal, postdiscal and marginal bands of darker scaling on a grey-brown ground; depth of colour varies between subspecies.
 
Slight sexual dimorphism. Male smaller than female. Male upperside buff with grey-brown margins and rows of black spots; forewing carries [i]prominent sex brand[/i], coloured dark brown to grey-brown in basal part of CuA1 and CuA2, spreading along veins M3, CuA1 and CuA2. Female usually brighter buff than male, with [i]rounded[/i] not [i]pointed[/i] wings. [i]T. p. terblanchei[/i] is the smallest subspecies. The upperside is the [i]brightest[/i] buff of the three, and has the palest upperside wing margins.
 
3 subspp., geographically distinct; varying in size and colour.
 
[i]T. protumnus[/i] lives in discrete colonies in flat country and on hillsides. These probably coincide with colonies of the host ant, a Pugnacious Ant, [i]Anaplolepis[/i] sp. Flight is low and fluttering but can be fast and sustained. Males are territorial and congregate around patches of bare gravelly or sandy soil; females fly around inspecting plants for the presence of their host ants. Should she find this she will lay one or two eggs.

Also resembles Lipara Buff [i]Baliochila lipara[/i] and Common Buff [i]B. aslanga[/i] but [i]both sexes[/i] have one dark costal mark just outside the forewing cell. No dark costal marks at the base of the forewing as in [i]Baliochila[/i] spp. Hind wing underside has orange-red marks on a brown ground; instead of being lines of prominent discrete spots as in [i]B. aslanga[/i] they form bands. These may be indistinct or even absent.
 
Sexes similar.
 
Weak, fluttering flight. Usually flies high in canopy, sometimes many seen flying together. Favours spaces with spindly saplings under large trees on forest edges. Settles on twigs, wings closed; periodically suddenly opening them. When doing this it resembles a tiny yellowed leaf waving in the breeze. Occasionally found roosting communally. Female flies lower, searching for oviposition sites. Often found in groups, imbibing honeydew from scale insects on twigs or leaves.

Small brightly coloured Skipper. Upperside brown with prominent [i]orange-yellow[/i] blotches. Cilia plain yellowish white. Underside [i]bright yellow-buff[/i] with [i]small black spots and streaks along veins[/i]. Upperside separable from Chequered Ranger [i]Kedestes lepenula[/i] by having upperside spots [i]square, a less orange shade of yellow[/i], and these are [i]separate, not fused into bands[/i]. Upperside also resembles that of larger Orange-spotted Hopper [i]Zenonia zeno[/i] but the forewing base is [i]not solid orange[/i]. The only other South African Skippers with similarly marked undersides are Axehead Orange [i]Acada biseriata[/i] and Morant's Orange [i]Parosmodes morantii[/i]. These have uppersides whose postdiscal orange markings are [i]continuous bands[/i], not spots. The former has its underside hind wing spots arranged in twos, and the latter has far fewer spots.
 
Sexes similar, female paler than male, rounder, more elongated wings, abdomen stouter, forewing upperside spots [i]more developed[/i].
 
Male does not hilltop, territorial in long grass in shade of trees. Female more sedentary, seldom seen, at random in the veld, seeking oviposition sites and feeding on flowers.

Identification
Medium–small white Pierid with red wing tips and varying degree of black wing markings. Underside varies in ground colour, and amount of [i]prominent black scaling along veins[/i], but both wings usually have a [i]distinct black cell spot[/i]. Larger than similar Common Orange Tip [i]Colotis evenina evenina[/i]; male upperside wing tips [i]red[/i], not [i]orange[/i]; female lacks [i]square, blocky marks[/i] on forewing underside. Compared to Smoky Orange Tip [i]C. euippe omphale[/i], it [i]lacks bulge in basal dark edge of orange tip[/i].
 
Sexually dimorphic. Generally, male apical third of forewing upperside [i]vermilion[/i], more or less [i]edged with black[/i], has black marginal hind wing border or spots, [i]black 'moustache'[/i] mark formed by black basal edge of forewing and hind wing costal edge. Female forewing upperside apical patch red to orange-yellow, with black veins, edged with black, black band proximal to patch or crossing it. Variable black basal forewing patch and black marginal borders on both wings, squared-off hind wing black discal band angled at M3.
 
Fast, low flight; wary and easily disturbed; hard to approach closely unless chilled by cool conditions. Male usually follows a 'beat' around a selected patch of bush. Both sexes often seen on flowers.
 
Seasonally polymorphic. There are many forms of both sexes, varying according to the seasons. There are many intermediates and the forms shown here only approximate the 'type' for each; the variation is gradual and no two individuals are exactly alike.
 
Extreme wet season f. [i]gavisa[/i] has [i]heavy black markings[/i] in both sexes, [i]prominent[/i] black underside veining. Female hind wing dark discal band fuses with marginal band. (A) Male upperside. (B) Male underside. (C) Female upperside. (D) Female underside.
 
F. [i]hero[/i] is more common wet season form; male upperside dark markings [i]reduced[/i]; underside has [i]reduced underside black veins[/i]. Female upperside usually more heavily marked than in f. [i]gavisa[/i]. Both sexes with underside variably tinged with yellow. (E) Male upperside. (F) Male underside. (G) Female upperside. (H) Female underside.
 
In drier areas, wet season form [i]helle[/i] is found; underside [i]white[/i] with [i]no black veins[/i]; heavy black upperside markings but the 'moustache' mark is reduced. (I) Male upperside. (J) Male underside.

Back to Top
Identification
South Africa's largest Pierid. Male appearance is constant across seasons and subspp., [i]size of black forewing tip[/i] being the main variable character. Like Buquet's Vagrant [i]Nepheronia buquetii[/i] it has conspicuous green eyes, but the male has a [i]creamy white, not green[/i] underside hind wing, and there is a [i]large square spot[/i] in the forewing underside tip.
 
Sexually dimorphic in that the female is never greenish white like the male, and always has [i]dark marks[/i] along the upperside margins, but not to the same extent as females of Cambridge Vagrant [i]N. Thalassina[/i]. There are several female forms. Wet season form females are larger, marginal upperside dark spots larger, hind wing upperside [i]white[/i]. Variable extent of basal orange-red on upperside forewing. Dry season form females are smaller, hind wing upperside varies from white, to patches of orange-yellow, to yellow and deep yellow-orange. Yellow hind wing forms rare at coast. F. [i]aurora[/i] most typical female form.
 
2 subspp., geographically distinct. Flight fast and direct, stopping seldom, unless at flowers (usually orange or red, but they are fond of [i]Plumbago[/i]) to nectar. Any bright red object will attract them.
 
[i]N. argia variegata[/i]: Male has larger black forewing tip than [i]N. a. varia[/i]. Females do not have the yellow or orange hind wing upperside of [i]N. a. varia[/i]. Nominate form [i]variegata[/i]; female has [i]white upperside[/i] with pale orange where the underside basal patch shows through to the upperside forewing. (K) Male upperside. (L) Male underside.

Back to Top
Identification
Small Charaxes. Male has shiny black upperside. Forewing margin has bluish-grey sheen and paler interneural smudges at the margin. The male is very similar to Van Son's Charaxes [i]Charaxes vansoni[/i]. It tends to have a slightly greater extent of silvery sheen along the underside hind wing costa, reaching the margin. But they are only reliably separable on genitalic dissection. Female is distinctive, resembling a male Large Blue Emperor, but not as large or robust.
 
Sexually dimorphic, only one female form, unlike [i]C. ethalion ethalion[/i].
 
Although this is a small Charaxes it lacks nothing in speed of flight or, in the male, pugnacity. Males form territories on hilltops, or in flat country, around prominent bushes and trees. They pursue any butterfly (or other flying creature) that ventures nearby. Females are found close to the host plants, or wandering around searching for males. Both sexes are often found drinking on wet mud.
 
Both sexes are attracted to rotting fruit, animal dung and sap leaking from wounded trees.

Identification
Small buff butterfly. Similar to Kaplan's Skolly [i]Thestor kaplani[/i] but with [i]elongated forewings, less convex outer margin, and more pointed forewings[/i]. The male's wing tip black does not invade the discal area to the same extent, so that the typical [i]Thestor[/i] spotting is more visible. Underside hind wing pale grey to brown with indistinct basal band and faint submarginal row of 'V'-shaped marks joined into a line. Has a dark, zigzag median line bent towards the margin between veins M1 and M3.
 
Sexually dimorphic. Male has [i]orange-buff[/i] wing bases and [i]heavy black[/i] wing tips; usual discal spotting merged into wingtip; tridentate sex brand is [i]large and grey-brown[/i]; covering basal part of CuA1 and CuA2, spreading along veins M3, CuA1 and CuA2. Underside hind wing pale grey with well-defined median line. Female is a more typical buff [i]Thestor[/i] type, with more pale colouring on wings. Dark bands heavy; shade of buff varies from dull buff to bright orange-buff. Underside hind wing pale brown with fainter median line than male.
 
[i]T. pringlei[/i] lives in colonies, usually on high, north-east facing mountain slopes, on flat, shale covered areas with shallow gullies and many small bushes. Fast, low flight, settling on rocks or low plants. Males form territories in open areas. Difficult to follow in flight; when settled, superbly camouflaged underside hard to spot. Usually found in groups of three or four, but in the right conditions can occur in large numbers. Females patrol the area, searching for suitable oviposition sites; these may be isolated twigs and dry grass stems in the middle of a dry area.

Identification
Very small butterfly with patterns of orange or orange-red and black on the upperside; has a greater or lesser amount of black in the centre of the forewing depending on sex and subspecies. Underside irrorated with black, grey and white with tiny submarginal spots on the hind wing. The other Rocksitters that fly in the same areas are Boland Rocksitter [i]Durbaniopsis saga[/i] and two of the races of Amakosa Rocksitter, [i]Durbania amakosa amakosa[/i] and [i]D. a. penningtoni[/i]. [i]Durbaniella clarki[/i] is generally smaller than either, although small males of [i]D. saga[/i] can be in the same size range. It can immediately be distinguished from that species by the underside; [i]D. clarki[/i] lacks the [i]conspicuous dark and light bands[/i] of [i]D. saga[/i]. Compared to [i]D. amakosa[/i], the differences are sex-related. Females of [i]D. amakosa[/i] are always much larger and have more extensive, better defined patterns of orange or orange-red and black on the upperside. [i]D. a. amakosa[/i] males have [i]discrete[/i] orange-red spots on the upperside. [i]D. a. penningtoni[/i] males have very similar upperside markings to [i]D. clarki[/i] but they are more of a [i]yellow-buff[/i] colour and the hind wing base is [i]dark[/i].
 
Variable degree of sexual dimorphism depending on subspecies. [i]D. c. belladonna[/i] is the [i]most intensely[/i] coloured of all four subspecies. The male is similar to that of [i]D. c. jenniferae[/i] but the arrowhead-shaped forewing postdiscal spots are [i]more elongated[/i]. The female upperside is almost totally orange with a narrow black border; the apical spots are [i]reduced or absent[/i] and the dark discal patch is reduced to a few dark spots at the end of the cell.
 
4 subspp., geographically distinct; varying in markings and colour.
 
Rocksitters, as their name suggests, like to sit on rocks; they do this for long periods with wings closed, their cryptic undersides hiding them well against lichen growing on the rock. Occasionally one will take off and patrol the area searching for mates. The flight is weak and fluttering, and they have trouble with headwinds, so they keep low, in the boundary layer. They lack a proboscis and cannot feed as adults, so they are never seen on flowers.

Identification
Medium–small white Pierid with orange wing tips and varying degree of black wing markings. Uniquely amongst Orange Tips, Smoky Orange Tip [i]Colotis euippe omphale[/i] has a [i]thickening[/i] in the black basal edge of the forewing orange tip. In some forms it is very obvious, in others it may be very slight or even reduced to an 'elbow' in the basal edge.
 
Sexes similar, white ground colour, black-edged red-orange forewing tips on upperside.
 
Fast, low flight. Both sexes fly at random, often seen on flowers.
 
Seasonally polymorphic. There are many forms of both sexes, varying according to the seasons. There are many intermediates and the forms shown here only approximate the 'type' for each; the variation is gradual and no two individuals are exactly alike.
 
The 'normal' wet season form in the eastern part of its range, f. [i]omphale[/i], has [i]heavy, zebra-striped[/i] series of black forewing basal and hind wing costal and postdiscal bands. Underside hind wing white, with orange marks speckled with black, and [i]dark postdiscal band parallel to costa[/i], corresponding with that of upperside. (A) Male upperside. (B) Male underside. (B) Female upperside.
 
There is an intermediate form with [i]reduced black bands[/i], which flies in autumn: f. [i]omphalioides[/i] resembles f. [i]omphale[/i], but the hind wing upperside horizontal band is [i]reduced or absent[/i] and the underside hind wing base colour is [i]pale pink, heavily irrorated with black scales[/i]. (C) Male upperside. (D) Male underside.
 
In the western areas, the 'summer form' resembles the 'winter form' of the eastern areas: f. [i]namaqua[/i] lacks the upperside black bands, but has a [i]pale pink to buff underside[/i], with [i]little or no[/i] black irroration. (E) Male upperside. (F) Male underside. (G) Female upperside.
 
The normal dry season f. [i]theogone[/i] has a similar upperside to Red Tip [i]C. antevippe gavisa[/i] f. [i]zera[/i] but the change in thickness of the basal black edge of the forewing upperside tip sets it apart. [i]Dark pink hind wing underside is heavily speckled with black[/i]. (F) Male upperside. (G) Female upperside. (H) Female underside.
 
Rare dry season female f. [i]ochreoleucus[/i] occasionally found in KwaZulu-Natal. Upper and underside surfaces are suffused with [i]yellow[/i] where other forms are [i]white[/i]. (I) Female upperside. (J) Female underside.

Identification
Small dark Skipper with [i]conspicuous white anal cilia and abdomen tip[/i] that are visible on the wing. The underside is beautifully marbled in brown and white, and is similar only to the [i]larger[/i] Nomad Dart [i]Andronymus neander neander[/i], or White Dart [i]A. caesar philander[/i]. The pale colouring, unlike in these species, [i]does not extend beyond the discal area[/i]. White-tail Hopper [i]Platylesches galesa[/i] also has a white abdomen tip and white hind wing anal margins, but the underside is [i]more uniformly patterned in grey[/i] and is [i]darker[/i], and [i]both sexes[/i] have [i]hyaline forewing spots[/i]. Cilia greyish white faintly chequered with darker grey. Cilia plain greyish white.
 
Sexes differ. Male upperside plain, female has white spots. Slightly seasonally dimorphic; wet season form f. [i]denia[/i] larger and darker than nominate dry season form, larger female forewing upperside spots; wider white hind wing upperside margin.
 
Male territorial along forest edges and paths, skipping around, settling for long periods on low vegetation. If disturbed, usually returns to original perch. Female seen less frequently. Both sexes visit flowers, and also feed on bird droppings; seldom observed feeding.

Identification
Small butterfly conspicuously [i]buff[/i] upperside and forewing underside, bordered with [i]grey-brown[/i] and having chequered cilia, the amount of contrast varying. Colour varies between subspecies, and within populations can range from bright cartridge-buff to a darker tawny-buff. Upperside and forewing underside carry variable number of dark spots, depending on subspecies and varying within populations. Hind wing underside has cryptic pattern of basal, postdiscal and marginal bands of darker scaling on a grey-brown ground; depth of colour varies between subspecies.
 
Slight sexual dimorphism. Male smaller than female. Male upperside buff with grey-brown margins and rows of black spots; forewing carries [i]prominent sex brand[/i], coloured dark brown to grey-brown in basal part of CuA1 and CuA2, spreading along veins M3, CuA1 and CuA2. Female usually brighter buff than male, with [i]rounded[/i] not [i]pointed[/i] wings. [i]T. p. aridus[/i] is paler than nominate with [i]more extensive[/i] upperside buff; desert form f. [i]mijburghi[/i] is very pale buff with black spots restricted to cells in female; male also has faint black apical spots. Amount of white in cilia varies.
 
3 subspp., geographically distinct; varying in size and colour.
 
id.
 
[i]T. protumnus[/i] lives in discrete colonies in flat country and on hillsides. These probably coincide with colonies of the host ant, a Pugnacious Ant, [i]Anaplolepis[/i] sp. Flight is low and fluttering but can be fast and sustained. Males are territorial and congregate around patches of bare gravelly or sandy soil; females fly around inspecting plants for the presence of their host ants. Should she find this she will lay one or two eggs.

One of a large group of [i]Chrysoritis[/i] Opals with [i]blue wing bases[/i] and a [i]shimmering, electric opalescent sheen[/i] over a varying area of the wings. For [i]Chrysoritis thysbe[/i], amount of blue on upperside varies, in some subspecies almost covering the forewing. Forewing underside has typical 'Copper' pattern of black spots on a pale ground with dark borders. Hind wing underside varies from plain sandy tan to dark brown, to [i]variegated[/i] with striae in various shades of reddish-brown, with bands of paler colouring and brassy postdiscal streaks. 'Plain' underside specimens usually have unicoloured cilia; 'variegated' ones dark cilia with pale interneural flecks, appearing 'chequered'.
 
[i]C. t. mithras[/i] has upperside solid blue darker than in [i]C. thysbe thysbe[/i] or [i]C. thysbe whitei[/i] and seldom extends beyond the forewing cell spot. Cilia orange with small pale interneural spots and black vein ends. Hind wing underside is variegated in dark brown and cream, with silvery white streaks. Sexes differ. Female has [i]rounder wings[/i], upperside blue [i]restricted to basal 25% of wings[/i], no opalescent sheen. The females of the various races are almost impossible to separate on wing patterns and identification usually requires comparison with males seen at the same locality.
 
7 subspp., not always geographically distinct. Rapid, sustained flight, settling on prominent bushes or rocks. Male intensively territorial on hill tops or sand dunes, regularly patrolling and chasing intruders; Females are found more at random, often on flowers.

Back to Top
Identification
[i]More dainty[/i] than other [i]Trimenia[/i] species. The wings are less [i]acutely pointed[/i], especially in the male; there is less difference between the sexes. The typical [i]Trimenia[/i] upperside pattern of more or less bright fulvous-orange on the upperside with dark borders, and black-and-white chequered cilia, is continued in this species. The undersides are slightly different, in that the hind wing silvery marks are [i]cursive[/i] as in Wallengren's Silver-spotted Copper, but form a more coherent pattern with a [i]large '3'- or 'W'-shaped postdiscal line[/i] and a central roughly triangular blotch. There are two underside colour morphs, brown-and-tan, and wine-red.
 
[i]T. malagrida cedrusmontana[/i]: has no dark veining and the dark upperside margins are [i]extensive and well-defined[/i]; the orange is a deep red shade. Sexes very similar, females generally larger, paler orange, heavier bodied.
 
4 subspp., geographically distinct, all rare. Found in small, discrete colonies; flight rapid but not sustained; males select a prominent perch on a low plant or rock and chase away intruders. Females are found more at random, often on flowers.

Large, dark Charaxes. In certain parts of its range, males can be confused with
Blue-Spotted Charaxes, [i]Charaxes cithaeron cithaeron[/i]. However, that species
has [i]much broader[/i] hind wing upperside pale patch, almost totally white. The
postdiscal series of forewing royal blue marks are [i]smaller[/i] in [i]C. xiphares[/i].
Females are distinctive. [i]C. x. staudei[/i] male smaller than [i]C. x. bavenda[/i] with
shorter tails, forewing upperside postdiscal spots [i]larger[/i]. Forewing underside pale
discal marks [i]larger[/i] than in [i]C. x. bavenda[/i]. Hind wing underside markings
generally more reduced and obscured than in [i]C. x. bavenda[/i]; basal black lines
usually absent. Female [i]smaller[/i] than [i]C. x. bavenda[/i] with larger forewing
upperside discal spots, particularly that in area CuA1 which is greatly elongated. The hind wing discal patch is generally smaller than in [i]C. x. bavenda[/i]. There are three female forms. Nominate upperside has white forewing discal spots and hind wing discal patch white suffused with lavender. In f. [i]arikae[/i] the hind wing discal patch is with yellow, and in [i]louisae[/i] the hind wing patch is blue.
 
Sexes strongly dimorphic, male with [i]royal blue[/i] spots and bands on metallic navy ground, female with [i]white discal forewing band[/i] (of variable width) sometimes invaded by yellow-ochre. Most females have a pale yellow hind wing upperside patch, but in some populations, it is blue-white or pale mauve. Differences between females is usually of more value than subtle differences between the males in distinguishing subspecies.
 
Powerful, high flight in the canopy and around tree tops. Males territorial, perching high up and pursuing any butterfly (or other flying creature) that ventures nearby. Females fly rapidly along the fringes of forests where they settle on tree leaves.
 
Both sexes are attracted to rotting fruit, animal dung and sap leaking from wounded trees.

Identification
Small buff butterfly. Male upperside forewing tips least heavily marked of the Compassberg Skolly group. Underside hind wing of both sexes pale grey with indistinct basal band and faint submarginal row of 'V'-shaped marks joined into a line. Has a dark, zigzag median line bent towards the margin between veins M1 and M3.
 
Sexually dimorphic. Male has [i]very broad[/i] marginal borders. Tridentate sex brand is grey-buff; restricted to veins M3, CuA1 and CuA2. Underside hind wing pale grey with darker grey basal and postdiscal bands; median line darker, better defined than female (cf. [i]T. pringlei[/i], Female is a more typical buff [i]Thestor[/i] type, with more pale colouring on wings. Dark bands heavy; shade of buff varies from dull buff to bright orange-buff.
 
[i]T. compassbergae[/i] lives in colonies, usually on high, north-east facing mountain slopes, between large rocks and on ridges. Fast, low flight, settling on rocks or low plants. Males form territories in areas of gravel. Difficult to follow in flight; when settled, superbly camouflaged underside hard to spot. Usually found in groups of three or four, but in the right conditions can occur in large numbers.

Medium–large white and orange Pierid. As common name implies, wing edges have black spots at the end of veins - variable in appearance, less prominent in dry season specimens. Can be told apart from other [i]Mylothris[/i] Dotted Borders by the orange basal forewing flush [i]on both surfaces of both sexes' forewings[/i]. Certain female forms of False Dotted Border [i]Belenois thysa[/i] also have basal forewing upperside colour flush, but they can immediately be told apart by the [i]double row of hind wing black spots[/i] on upper and undersides. Other white Pierids with white wings carrying a basal orange flush are certain female forms of Large Vagrant [i]N. argia[/i], but those are [i]much larger[/i] and have [i]more extensive dark marginal marks[/i].
 
Sexually dimorphic, female upperside orange is paler and of a more yellow hue than the male, and covering at least the basal half of both wings, not just the basal third of the forewing.
 
Slow, fluttering flight, often high in forest canopy near host plants; both sexes fond of flowers; may also be found low down along forest paths and rides.

Identification
Small butterfly conspicuously [i]buff[/i] upperside and forewing underside, bordered with [i]grey-brown[/i] and having chequered cilia, the amount of contrast varying. Colour varies between subspecies, and within populations can range from bright cartridge-buff to a darker tawny-buff. Upperside and forewing underside carry variable number of dark spots, depending on subspecies and varying within populations. Hind wing underside has cryptic pattern of basal, postdiscal and marginal bands of darker scaling on a grey-brown ground; depth of colour varies between subspecies.
 
Slight sexual dimorphism. Male smaller than female. Male upperside buff with grey-brown margins and rows of black spots; forewing carries [i]prominent sex brand[/i], coloured dark brown to grey-brown in basal part of CuA1 and CuA2, spreading along veins M3, CuA1 and CuA2. Female usually brighter buff than male, with [i]rounded[/i] not [i]pointed[/i] wings. Nominate subspecies [i]Thestor protumnus protumnus[/i] is the darkest and has the heaviest upperside spotting, and the most prominently white chequered cilia. Occasional males have very dark buff colouring.
 
3 subspp., geographically distinct; varying in size and colour.
 
[i]T. protumnus[/i] lives in discrete colonies in flat country and on hillsides. These probably coincide with colonies of the host ant, a Pugnacious Ant, [i]Anaplolepis[/i] sp. Flight is low and fluttering but can be fast and sustained. Males are territorial and congregate around patches of bare gravelly or sandy soil; females fly around inspecting plants for the presence of their host ants. Should she find this she will lay one or two eggs.

Sexually dimorphic. The male has vaguely defined forewing apical spots of ground colour on a dark brown wing tip; female larger, with [i]pale buff to orange[/i] marks on black forewing tip, spreading into cell.
 
Fond of sitting on tree bark, also roosts under leaves. Flipping, short flight from tree trunk to tree trunk. Very wary and hard to approach closely. Occurs in smaller numbers than [i]S. boisduvali[/i], but much more numerous than [i]S. morantii[/i]. Shy, difficult to approach; sits on tree trunks, darting away when disturbed. Strongly attracted to fermenting fruit and sap leaking from wounded trees. Comes readily to baited traps.

Identification
Medium-sized white Pierid with coloured or black forewing tips. Very similar to Coast Purple Tip [i]Colotis erone[/i]. Male upperside always white; black forewing apical tip with [i]four[/i] not [i]three[/i], discrete metallic purple cells; has dusting of grey scales in black margin. Some specimens have a tiny extra spot of purple on costal edge of tip. Shade of purple [i]shiny and iridescent[/i], but not to the same extent as Queen Purple Tip [i]C. regina[/i]. That butterfly has a distinct two-tone purple-green 'flop' in the wing tip. Underside varies from pinkish white in all dry season forms [i]but greyer and dingier[/i] than Coast Purple Tip; white through cream to yellow in wet season forms; distinctive dark markings remain the same.
 
Sexually dimorphic; males always have a [i]purple[/i] upperside forewing tip; females
have several colour morphs - [i]orange-tipped, black-tipped and some have brown or cream patches in the black[/i]. They generally have [i]five to six spots[/i] in the wing tip, compared to [i]three to four[/i] in female f. [i]erone[/i].
 
Fast, erratic flight, settling seldom except to feed at flowers. In cloudy weather may stop to bask in sunny patches. Females are less often seen than males because they are more retiring, but also often come to flowers.
 
Seasonally polymorphic. Male nominotypical wet season f. [i]ione[/i], found mainly in KwaZulu-Natal, has extensive black veins on hind wing upperside and on edge of forewing upperside tip, and underside has [i]heavy black veining[/i] on white or cream ground colour, with a dark band crossing the hind wing postdiscal area. (A) Male upperside. (B) Male underside.
 
Wet season male in the rest of Southern Africa is f. [i]phlegyas[/i], which has [i]reduced[/i] black veining in the forewing and [i]faint or absent[/i] black underside veining on white or cream ground colour. (C) Male upperside. (D) Male underside.
 
There are several wet season female forms. F. [i]ione[/i] has [i]orange[/i] forewing tips outlined in black, with some red at the basal edge, and [i]heavy black[/i] upperside marginal borders, a [i]dark band[/i] along the forewing inner margin, dark wing bases, and a dark line crossing the postdiscal area of the hind wing. Underside marked with yellow and buff and has [i]dark marks[/i] corresponding to those on upperside. (E) Female upperside. (F) Female underside.

Dry season male f. [i]jalone[/i] has [i]extensive grey scaling[/i] in black border to forewing upperside tip: [i]almost no[/i] black veins in forewing upperside white area, and [i]reduced[/i] hind wing upperside black veins. Underside hind wing ground colour [i]pink, irrorated with darker brown striae[/i], and crossed by a brown postdiscal stripe. (M) Male upperside. (N) Male underside.
 
There are several dry season female forms. F. [i]jalone[/i] has [i]orange[/i] forewing tips edged in brown, with other dark markings [i]restricted or absent[/i]. Underside resembles male f. [i]jalone[/i]; ground colour [i]pink, irrorated with darker brown striae[/i], basal and discal areas darker brown divided from rest of wing by postdiscal stripe. (O) Female upperside. (P) Female underside.

Identification
Medium-sized canopy butterfly, dark with prominent paler markings. Resembles distasteful members of the genus [i]Amauris[/i] but generally so, the resemblance is not exact and the colours do not exactly match. [i]P. l. expansa[/i] has two discrete forms. Wing markings white in f. [i]expansa[/i], dark orange in f. [i]heliogenes[/i].
 
Sexes alike, female with markings identical to male, but with rounder wings.
 
Floating, sailing flight, wings open flat, with infrequent rapid wingbeats. This distinguishes them from the more fluttering flight of the models. If disturbed they can put on a turn of speed. Male territorial, perching on prominent forest-edge leaves, chasing intruders. If chased away he usually returns to the same perch. The female is less active. Both sexes are often seen nectaring on flowering trees. Occasionally found low down, drinking at mud puddles.

Similar in wing shape and habits to Vàri's Brown [i]P. vàrii[/i], but [i]only two[/i] ocelli in anal angle of hind wing underside. Populations vary in amount of dark marking on hind wing underside; some have a dark transverse band and submarginal line but never as heavy as in [i]P. vàrii[/i]. This butterfly was described from a wetland surrounded by forest at about 1500m altitude near Houtbosdorp in Limpopo. That population appears to have died out, but similar butterflies have been found in high altitude marshes over a wide range of country to the south. These fly at altitudes from just over 2000m on Long Tom Pass in Mpumalanga to over 2300m atop Platberg near Harrismith in the Free State. Opinions vary as to whether these are true [i]P. swanepoel[/i], a subspecies of it, or a hitherto undescribed new species. The photographs shown here are from these populations.
 
Sexes similar. Female smaller, with wings more rounded. Male hind wing underside can be spectacular, resembling [i]beaten pewter[/i]. Crooked discal band crossing wing is more prominent in female.
 
May fly in huge numbers in vleis and marshes. Flight bouncing, slow; female reluctant to take wing.

Identification
Small white Pierid with bright orange or dark brown or black wing tips. All forms of male have black edge of forewing upperside apical tip [i]only reaching one-third of the way from margin to costa[/i]. Where this ends, in M3, it [i]bends towards apex, forming an elbow penetrating the orange[/i].
 
Sexually dimorphic. Male upperside [i]always has bright orange forewing tip[/i]; dark markings range from almost none in extreme dry season forms, to a [i]heavy black 'moustache' mark running along inner margin of forewing and costal margin of hind wing[/i], and a [i]broad black hind wing marginal border[/i]. Very many female forms; upperside of many resembles female Bushveld Orange Tip, upperside varying from full 'moustache' to dark wing bases only; forewing apical patch dark markings varying in extent; tip colour varies from bright orange to buff and pale yellow; ground colour from white to pale yellow.
 
Relatively weak, low flight. Both sexes fly at random, often seen on flowers.
 
Seasonally polymorphic. There are many forms, particularly of the female, varying according to the seasons. There are many intermediates and the forms shown here only approximate the 'type' for each; the variation is gradual and no two individuals are exactly alike.
 
All wet season forms' undersides have [i]white to yellow[/i] ground colour, more or less extensively marked with black and orange. The male of the extreme wet season form, [i]emini[/i], has the upperside 'moustache' mark extended to reach the outer margin; hind wing dark margin carries [i]no pale blotches[/i]. The female is similar but the upperside dark areas are even more extensive, to the point where the white markings may be reduced to reduced to [i]small streaks and blotches[/i]. (A) Male upperside. (B) Male underside. (C) Female underside.
 
A commoner wet season form is the less heavily marked f. [i]phlegetonia[/i]. The dark markings are similar but the upperside 'moustache' mark [i]does not reach the outer margin[/i]; hind wing dark margin [i]has row of submarginal pale blotches[/i]. The female sometimes has extensive orange tips. (D) Male upperside. (E) Male underside. (F) Female upperside. (G) Female underside.
 
There is a transitional form, [i]galathinus[/i]. The upperside is similar to the wet
season forms, with the 'moustache' mark [i]faint but visible[/i], with some features of
the dry season forms - the female upperside sometimes has a [i]yellow[/i] ground
colour, and has a [i]squared-off hind wing dark postdiscal band[/i], angled outwards at the cell. The underside hind wing of both sexes has a [i]pink to buff ground colour, irrorated with grey scales[/i], which is typical of the dry season forms. (H) Male upperside. (I) Male underside. (J) Female upperside.
 
The normal dry season form is [i]delphine[/i]; the male totally lacks a 'moustache' mark and the hind wing upperside margin is [i]white with a row of interneural black spots[/i]. The female is one of a range of dry season forms; the upperside has a pale orange forewing tip and carries a faint 'moustache' mark; has a faint dark hind wing dark postdiscal band. The underside hind wing of both sexes has a [i]pink to buff ground colour, irrorated with grey scales[/i]. (K) Male upperside. (L) Male underside. (M) Female upperside. (N) Mating pair undersides, female to R.
 
Female form [i]pseudetrida[/i] resembles f. [i]delphine[/i] but has orange-yellow cells in the upperside forewing tip; the upperside ground colour is [i]pale yellow[/i]. The underside is the same as other dry season forms. (O) Female upperside. (P) Female underside.
 
In female form [i]wa[/i] the dark markings are [i]much reduced[/i], with the forewing upperside dark tip carrying a row of [i]pale yellow streaks[/i]. Ground colour is [i]cream to pale yellow[/i]. The underside is the same as other dry season forms. (Q) Female upperside.
 
In female form [i]xanthotes[/i] the dark markings are [i]restricted to the margin[/i], with the forewing upperside tip reduced to a row of [i]pale yellow streaks with a dark basal stripe[/i].

Back to Top
Identification
Small, brightly coloured Opal. Markings similar to Common Opal [i]Chrysoritis thysbe bamptoni[/i], with which it flies. It is very similar to that butterfly, and the main difference is the extent of the 'solid' (as opposed to opalescent) forewing upperside blue. It covers the greater part of the wing, penetrating the apex with 'fingers' of blue iridescence penetrating between the apical spots. Forewing underside has typical 'Copper' pattern of black spots on a pale ground with dark borders. Underside hind wing variegated, less variably so than Pan Opal, with bands of [i]deep, rich brown[/i].
 
Sexes differ. Female has [i]reduced[/i] upperside basal blue, and [i]more widely spaced[/i] black spots than male.
 
Found in colonies on flat sandy ground between inland sand dunes. Males perch on a prominent bush, and fly off rapidly to chase any intruders. Females are more sedentary. Both sexes are often found on flowers. By comparison, Common Opal [i]Chrysoritis thysbe bamptoni[/i] occupies the slopes and ridges of the dunes, where Lyndsey's Opal may venture - the two can be found flying together.

Identification
[i]More dainty[/i] than other [i]Trimenia[/i] species. The wings are less [i]acutely pointed[/i], especially in the male; there is less difference between the sexes. The typical [i]Trimenia[/i] upperside pattern of more or less bright fulvous-orange on the upperside with dark borders, and black-and-white chequered cilia, is continued in this species. The undersides are slightly different, in that the hind wing silvery marks are [i]cursive[/i] as in Wallengren's Silver-spotted Copper, but form a more coherent pattern with a [i]large '3'- or 'W'-shaped postdiscal line[/i] and a central roughly triangular blotch. There are two underside colour morphs, brown-and-tan, and wine-red.
 
Nominate [i]Trimenia malagrida malagrida[/i] is a dark subspecies with dull red-orange upperside and a tendency for the paler areas to have dark lines along the veins. Sexes very similar, females generally larger, paler orange, heavier bodied.
 
4 subspp., geographically distinct, all rare. Found in small, discrete colonies; flight rapid but not sustained; males select a prominent perch on a low plant or rock and chase away intruders. Females are found more at random, often on flowers.

Medium to large (for a lycaenid), showy sapphire with distinctive pattern of black-and-white postdiscal blotches and basal violaceous blue on the forewing, and streaked pattern of white, violaceous blue and grey-black on the hind wing. The only similar species in South Africa is Dusky Sapphire, [i]S. subinfuscata reynoldsi[/i], but the upperside violaceous blue colouring tends to be [i]lighter[/i]. The major difference is on the underside, where the marginal bands and the area basal to the hind wing dark median band are [i]pale grey or white[/i], not dark grey.
 
The sexes are very similar; females tend to have [i]more extensive[/i] white in the apical area of the forewing upperside. [i]S. b. henningi[/i] is a deeper shade of violaceous blue than the other subspecies with the white in the forewing apical area [i]reduced or absent[/i].
 
3 subspp., geographically distinct. Flight fast, but slower than other sapphires. Males perch alert on or in prominent bushes on low rocky ridges, chasing intruders; female more sedentary, more usually found near host plants.

Sexually dimorphic, only one female form, unlike [i]C. ethalion ethalion[/i].
 
Fast, agile, high flight. Males territorial in forest canopy, perching high up and pursuing any butterfly (or other flying creature) that ventures nearby. Females fly more slowly, low along the fringes of forests where they settle on tree leaves.
 
Both sexes are attracted to rotting fruit, animal dung and sap leaking from wounded trees. Male appears to be less fond of fruit baits than other black [i]Charaxes[/i].

Identification
One of a large group of [i]Chrysoritis[/i] Opals with [i]blue wing bases[/i] and a [i]shimmering, electric opalescent sheen[/i] over a varying area of the wings. For [i]Chrysoritis thysbe[/i], amount of blue on upperside varies, in some subspecies almost covering the forewing. Forewing underside has typical 'Copper' pattern of black spots on a pale ground with dark borders. Hind wing underside varies from plain sandy tan to dark brown, to [i]variegated[/i] with striae in various shades of reddish-brown, with bands of paler colouring and brassy postdiscal streaks. 'Plain' underside specimens usually have unicoloured cilia; 'variegated' ones dark cilia with pale interneural flecks, appearing 'chequered'.
 
Nominate [i]Chrysoritis thysbe thysbe[/i] usually has chequered cilia and variegated underside. Sexes differ. Female has [i]rounder wings[/i], upperside blue [i]restricted to basal 25% of wings[/i], no opalescent sheen. The females of the various races are almost impossible to separate on wing patterns and identification usually requires comparison with males seen at the same locality.
 
7 subspp., not always geographically distinct. Rapid, sustained flight, settling on prominent bushes or rocks. Male intensively territorial on hill tops or sand dunes, regularly patrolling and chasing intruders; Females are found more at random, often on flowers.

Underside dove grey fading to white towards the outer margin, with series of prominent white-edged black spots. Both wing surfaces of the hind wing carry a [i]conspicuous[/i] marginal black spot in area CuA2, edged basally with an orange lunule. The orange spreads into CuA1 and sometimes M3 and 1A+2A. In this it differs from Tailed Meadow Blue, which has a [i]much more extensive[/i] orange patch, spreading across the entire anal margin of the hind wing from 1A+2A to M2 and in some specimens RS.
 
Sexually dimorphic. Male upperside [i]deep clear blue[/i], dark margins [i]narrow[/i], female upperside blue [i]suffused distally with white[/i], marginal borders [i]wide[/i].
 
Fast, erratic flight; can be mistaken for one of the blue [i]Lepidochrysops[/i] species. Usually found [i]singly or in small groups[/i] in open Grassland. Males patrol hillsides; females are found close to the host plants.

Large, dark Charaxes. In certain parts of its range, males can be confused with Blue-Spotted Charaxes, [i]Charaxes cithaeron cithaeron[/i]. However, that species has [i]much broader[/i] hind wing upperside pale patch, almost totally white. The postdiscal series of forewing royal blue marks are [i]smaller[/i] in [i]C. xiphares[/i]. Females are distinctive. [i]C. x. draconis[/i] has short, blunt tails in both sexes and, in the female, even larger upperside pale markings than [i]C. x. penningtoni[/i]. Has two female forms, nominate and f. [i]candida[/i], which has a white hind wing upperside discal patch, with a violet sheen at the edges.
 
Sexes strongly dimorphic, male with [i]royal blue[/i] spots and bands on metallic navy ground, female with [i]white discal forewing band[/i] (of variable width) sometimes invaded by yellow-ochre. Most females have a pale yellow hind wing upperside patch, but in some populations, it is blue-white or pale mauve. Differences between females is usually of more value than subtle differences between the males in distinguishing subspecies.
 
Powerful, high flight in the canopy and around tree tops. Males territorial, perching high up and pursuing any butterfly (or other flying creature) that ventures nearby. Females fly rapidly along the fringes of forests where they settle on tree leaves.
 
Both sexes are attracted to rotting fruit, animal dung and sap leaking from wounded trees.

Medium-sized butterfly. Battling Glider is the smaller of South Africa's two [i]Cymothoe[/i] species; the other being Blonde Glider [i]Cymothoecoranus[/i]. Compared to that species, apart from size, [i]C. alcimeda[/i] has [i]more angulate[/i] wings and, usually, a more [i]heavily marked[/i] underside.
 
[i]C. a. clarki[/i] males are less heavily-marked than in [i]C. a. alcimeda[/i], and the population has a greater proportion of orange- and grey-banded females than in [i]C. a. trimeni[/i], which it resembles. Sexually dimorphic: male upperside creamy white; both sexes' underside cryptic.
 
Both sexes have the typical Limenitidinae gliding flight with bursts of rapid wingbeats. Males perch high up on forest edge trees and shrubs, and sally forth to chase away all other insects. When there is more than one male in a forest clearing, constant aerial battles take place, hence the common name. Females are found close to the host plants. Both sexes regularly drink at wet mud, and nectar from flowers. They are also attracted to fruit bait.

A smaller Playboy. The only male [i]Virachola[/i] Playboy in South Africa that can be confused with Orange-barred Playboy [i]Virachola diocles[/i] but the forewing is [i]uniformly dark brown or black[/i], may have a slight patch of paler scales in the discal area, but never a band; also shot with purple when viewed at an acute angle.
 
Underside of both sexes is grey, [i]paler[/i] than other [i]Virachola[/i] Playboys; male in particular has [i]bright white suffusion[/i] on hind wing. Submarginal and postdiscal rows of darker grey and white lines are 'cut' into segments by the wing veins, and there are [i]large, bright red basal hind wing spots[/i]. Both sexes have a single white-tipped tail at the hind wing anal angle.
 
Sexes differ on the upperside. The female is [i]blackish-brown[/i] with [i]whitish[/i] discal patches, never [i]dove-grey[/i] or [i]pale-blue[/i] as in other Playboy females.
 
Males spend midday whirling around tree tops; seen usually early morning or late afternoon with females on flowers; may perch lower down on hilltops or along paths in low coastal bush.

Medium to large butterfly, with weak but sustained fluttering flight, sometimes sailing, at medium height, 2–3m above the ground. Usually found flying alone or in small groups, but may be found in large numbers on wounded plants exuding pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Fond of nectar. This species has complex biogeography; it is widespread across Asia, southern Europe and the whole of Africa. Several subspecies occur across this range, the relationship between these is the subject of several studies.
 
In SA the commonest form is [i]Danaus chrysippus orientis[/i], which has a white-spotted black forewing tip and a plain orange hind wing. The size of the white forewing tips varies, from small discrete spots to a continuous, jagged edged band.
 
Typical [i]Danaus chrysippus orientis[/i], as found in South Africa, has a tawny orange upperside with black marginal borders containing small white spots. There is a variable degree of darker chocolate-brown basal suffusion.

A shade-loving butterfly that is usually seen fluttering among undergrowth along forest paths, and settling on leaves or tree bark. Its upperside is brightly coloured and conspicuous in flight; underside is well camouflaged against dead leaves and bark. The sexes are similar; females are slightly larger and paler on the upperside.
 
Four subspecies, geographically separated.
 
[i]Paralethe dendrophilus indosa[/i] specimens tend to the larger end of the wingspan range. (F) Male underside. (G) Female upperside. The forewing spots are bright white; occasionally the inner-basal ones are tinged with ochre.
Models

Back to Top
Identification
Small white Pierid with bright orange or dark brown or black wing tips. Male upperside resembles small Red Tip [i]Colotis antevippe gavisa[/i]; wings [i]more rounded[/i], orange forewing tips [i]duller[/i]. Male is easy to distinguish from Small Orange Tip [i]C. evagore antigone[/i] by the [i]lack of small black 'elbow'[/i] at outer basal edge of tip; basal edge of tip edged with black across wing with no breaks, even in very pale individuals. Forewing of both sexes always has distinct [i]black spot at end of cell[/i]. Wet season males have a [i]'moustache'[/i] as in Red Tip; in dry season forms, reduced to basal dark patch or absent.
 
Sexually dimorphic. Female basic pattern is white ground colour with dark upperside wing tip carrying an orange patch variable from absent to large, and a [i]'moustache'[/i] that is heavy in WSFs and weak, but still present, in DSFs. Hind wing has dark marginal and submarginal bands, latter angled outwards at cell. The forewing underside apical patch carries [i]no deep orange areas[/i], but dry season forms may have pale orange suffusion.
 
Seasonally polymorphic. There are a large number of named seasonal forms. There are many intermediates and the forms shown here only approximate the 'type' for each; the variation is gradual and no two individuals are exactly alike. Female WSFs have heavy upperside dark markings and pale underside hind wing, DSFs with lighter upperside markings, pink hind wing underside with black scaling, dark postdiscal spots. These can be told apart from the very similar female DSF Small Orange Tip by the [i]lack of underside forewing orange tip[/i], and the patch distal to the hind wing underside cell, which is [i]paler[/i] in [i]C. evagore[/i], but [i]same grey-irrorated pink or buff[/i] as rest of hind wing in [i]C. pallene[/i]. In many intermediates, forewing upperside apical patch varies from broad orange cells to none at all as in f. [i]absurda[/i].
 
The most heavily marked wet season form is [i]infumatus[/i], with extensive dark markings, a [i]broad[/i] hind wing marginal band, and a pale, lightly marked underside. (A) Male upperside. (B) Male underside. Females resemble those of form [i]pallene[/i] (F).
 
The normal summer form in KwaZulu-Natal is f. [i]seineri[/i], which is more lightly marked with the hind wing marginal band usually broken into triangular spots. (D) Male upperside. Females resemble those of form [i]pallene[/i] (F).
 
Form [i]pallene[/i] is the most lightly marked wet season form, which has the black 'moustache' in the male reduced. (D) Male upperside. (E) Male underside. (F) Female upperside.
 
The dry season form most often encountered is f. [i]halyattes[/i], whose male has the dark 'moustache' reduced to a basal patch, and has small hind wing marginal dark spots. The female has similar markings to the wet season forms but they are reduced. Dry season form undersides are extensively speckled with dark grey, often with a [i]pink suffusion[/i]. (G) Male upperside. (H) Male underside. (I) Female upperside. (J) Female underside.
 
Extreme dry season form [i]pallida[/i] male has dark basal marking [i]much reduced or absent[/i]; females still have dark markings but these are [i]much reduced[/i]. (K) Male upperside. (L) Male and female undersides (in copula). (M) Male underside. (N) Female upperside.
 
Some dry season females lack orange in the wing tips and have totally black tips as in females of Small Orange Tip form [i]delphinus[/i]. (O) Female upperside. (P) Female underside.
 
Also, some females - wet or dry forms - have the upperside ground colour creamy yellow, not white. This form is not named. (Q) Female upperside.

Sexes similar; females usually larger and paler than males.
 
Males show very territorial behaviour; they choose a prominent twig or leaf in the territory. On this they perch and make circular sorties around their territory, a 'beat' from which the common name derives. Females are more sedentary and are usually found near the host plants.

Sexes similar. Male has narrower, more angular wings, and pale bands are [i]pale buff[/i] in common [i]eurytus[/i], orange in very rare f. [i]pondo[/i]. Females have longer, broader wings and the pale bands are white in the commoner f. [i]chionea[/i]; the rarer f. [i]eurytus[/i] has bands the same pale buff colour as the male.
 
Floating, sailing flight, wings open flat, with infrequent rapid wingbeats. The model also has a floating flight, but appears weaker and the wingbeats are slower. If disturbed they can put on a turn of speed. Male territorial, perching on prominent forest-edge leaves, chasing intruders. If chased away he usually returns to the same perch. The female is less active. They are not as often seen nectaring as the other local [i]Pseudacraea[/i] species. Occasionally found low down, drinking at mud puddles.

Why it should have been recorded from the haunts of the similar and closely related Highveld Blue is one of the enduring mysteries of South African lepidoptera; as the two gentlemen were contemporaries, a mix up of labels is suspected by some workers.

Identification
Very large, conspicuous black and yellow butterfly with well-developed spatulate tails. Largest South African butterfly. Closest in markings to Citrus Swallowtail [i]Papilio demodocus[/i] but [i]much larger and has hind wing tails[/i]. Constantine's Swallowtail [i]P. constantinus[/i] and Bush Kite [i]P. euphranor[/i] are both superficially similar but [i]lack large blue hind wing postdiscal lunules on both wing surfaces[/i]. The forewing discal band of spots varies in shape and width between the subspecies.
 
The nominate subspecies is not found in South Africa. [i]P. ophidicephalus phalusco[/i] is the most widespread local subspecies. It has been quoted as the largest, although big females of [i]P. ophidicephalus zuluensis[/i] may be larger. The forewing discal band of yellow spots is [i]nearly straight[/i]; widens towards the apex. In males the spots in areas R3 to M2 are usually [i]joined[/i]; in females the spots may be joined as far down the wing as CuA1. Sexes similar; male has [i]bands of shiny scent scales[/i] on forewing between postdiscal and submarginal yellow spots. Females have varying degrees of irroration with yellow scales in these areas.
 
5 subspp., geographically distinct. Flies fast with powerful wingbeats; may stoop low
to investigate flowers. Follows gullies and roads in thick forest. Males are often seen
mud puddling; females on flowers and host plants.

Underside hind wing pale grey to brown with indistinct basal band and faint submarginal row of 'V'-shaped marks joined into a line. Has a dark, zigzag median line bent towards the margin between veins M1 and M3.
 
Sexually dimorphic. Male has [i]golden-buff[/i] wing bases and [i]heavy black[/i] wing tips; usual discal spotting merged into wingtip; tridentate sex brand is also golden-buff; restricted to veins M3, CuA1 and CuA2. Underside hind wing pale grey with well-defined median line. Female is a more typical buff [i]Thestor[/i] type, with more pale colouring on wings. Dark bands heavy; shade of buff varies from dull buff to bright orange-buff. Underside hind wing pale brown with fainter median line than male; cf. Female [i]T. compassbergae[/i] and [i]T. pringlei[/i].
 
[i]T. kaplani[/i] lives in colonies, usually on high, north-east facing mountain slopes, between large rocks and on ridges. Fast, low flight, settling on rocks or low plants. Males form territories in areas of gravel. Difficult to follow in flight; when settled, superbly camouflaged underside hard to spot. Usually found in groups of three or four, but in the right conditions can occur in large numbers.

Back to Top
Identification
[i]More dainty[/i] than other [i]Trimenia[/i] species. The wings are less [i]acutely pointed[/i], especially in the male; there is less difference between the sexes. The typical [i]Trimenia[/i] upperside pattern of more or less bright fulvous-orange on the upperside with dark borders, and black-and-white chequered cilia, is continued in this species. The undersides are slightly different, in that the hind wing silvery marks are [i]cursive[/i] as in Wallengren's Silver-spotted Copper, but form a more coherent pattern with a [i]large '3'- or 'W'-shaped postdiscal line[/i] and a central roughly triangular blotch. There are two underside colour morphs, brown-and-tan, and wine-red.
 
[i]T. malagrida maryae[/i]: largest subspecies with most extensive ochreous orange on upperside; black distal borders [i]narrower[/i] than the other subspecies. Sexes very similar, females generally larger, paler orange, heavier bodied.
 
4 subspp., geographically distinct, all rare. Found in small, discrete colonies; flight rapid but not sustained; males select a prominent perch on a low plant or rock and chase away intruders. Females are found more at random, often on flowers.

Small black-and-orange/red butterflies; uppersides are black with varying degrees of red/orange spots and blotches. Undersides are beautifully camouflaged against their habitat; intricate patterns of black or dark grey on a white or pale grey ground, with submarginal spots in varying shades of red to orange, yellow or white. There are some similar species to Amakosa Rocksitter; Natal Rocksitter [i]Durbania limbata[/i] upperside has outer half of hind wing [i]broad[/i] red; sexes similar and flies in late summer to autumn, not spring and early summer. And Clark's Rocksitter [i]D. clarki[/i] is much smaller and its range does not overlap with that of [i]D. amakosa[/i].
 
Sexually dimorphic. [i]D. a. ayresi[/i] is similar to [i]D. a. natalensis[/i] but the upperside markings are [i]more yellowish[/i] and in the male, the orange hind wing spots are fused into a continuous band.
 
7 subspp., geographically distinct.
 
Rocksitters, as their name suggests, like to sit on rocks; they do this for long periods with wings closed, their cryptic undersides hiding them well against lichen growing on the rock. Occasionally one will take off and patrol the area searching for mates. The flight is weak and fluttering, and they have trouble with headwinds, so they keep low, in the boundary layer. They lack a proboscis and cannot feed as adults, so they are never seen on flowers.

Small Charaxes. Male has shiny black upperside. Forewing margin has bluish-grey sheen and paler interneural smudges at the margin. The male is very similar to Demon Charaxes [i]Charaxes phaeus[/i]. It tends to have hind wing underside silvery sheen on costa not spreading beyond the cell. But they are only reliably separable on genitalic dissection. Female resembles [i]C. ethalion ethalion[/i], but smaller, and more extensive silvery blue surrounding hind wing white median band. Forewing white discal spots often suffused with peach-pink. Male territorial on hill tops.
 
Sexually dimorphic, only one female form, unlike [i]C. ethalion ethalion[/i].
 
Although this is a small Charaxes it lacks nothing in speed of flight or, in the male, pugnacity. Males form territories on hilltops, or in flat country, around prominent bushes and trees. They pursue any butterfly (or other flying creature) that ventures nearby. Females are found close to the host plants, or wandering around searching for males. Both sexes are often found drinking on wet mud.

Females are distinctive. [i]C. x. thyestes[/i], in the male, costal hind wing upperside spots blue, tinged [i]slightly[/i] with white; double black spots at tornus of forewing underside [i]fused[/i]. Female hind wing upperside yellow patch [i]paler[/i] than in nominate.
 
Sexes strongly dimorphic, male with [i]royal blue[/i] spots and bands on metallic navy ground, female with [i]white discal forewing band[/i] (of variable width) sometimes invaded by yellow-ochre. Most females have a pale yellow hind wing upperside patch, but in some populations, it is blue-white or pale mauve. Differences between females is usually of more value than subtle differences between the males in distinguishing subspecies.
 
Powerful, high flight in the canopy and around tree tops. Males territorial, perching high up and pursuing any butterfly (or other flying creature) that ventures nearby. Females fly rapidly along the fringes of forests where they settle on tree leaves.
 
Both sexes are attracted to rotting fruit, animal dung and sap leaking from wounded trees.

Tiny to small buff butterfly. Resembles Lipara Buff [i]Baliochila lipara[/i] or Common Buff [i]B. aslanga[/i] but [i]both sexes[/i] have one dark costal mark just outside the forewing cell. No dark costal marks at the base of the forewing as in [i]Baliochila[/i] spp. Hind wing underside has orange-red marks on a brown ground; instead of being lines of prominent discrete spots as in [i]B. aslanga[/i] they form bands. These may be indistinct or even absent. There is some seasonal dimorphism; dry season individuals tend to have paler, [i]less well-marked[/i] hind wing undersides. Rare Pallid Buff [i]C. pallida[/i] is very similar; only reliably distinguished by genitalic dissection, but usually has [i]pale grey[/i] irroration on dark forewing tip.
 
Sexes similar.
 
Weak, fluttering flight. Usually flies high in canopy, sometimes many seen flying together. Favours spaces with spindly saplings under large trees on forest edges. Settles on twigs, wings closed; periodically suddenly opening them. When doing this it resembles a tiny yellowed leaf waving in the breeze. Occasionally found roosting communally. Female flies lower, searching for oviposition sites. Often found in groups, imbibing honeydew from scale insects on twigs or leaves.

The only other Skipper to have '[i]Acraea[/i]'-like hind wing underside markings is Spotted Velvet Skipper, [i]Abantis tettensis[/i], but that species' upperside is conspicuously [i]pied[/i] in black and white, and does not fly in the same areas.
 
Sexes similar; female larger with stouter abdomen and more rounded wings.
 
Flight fairly slow, skipping, hopping. Shy and wary; if disturbed, flies off rapidly, seldom returning. Male does not hilltop; establishes territories along edges of thick bush and forest, perching high on a prominent twig or leaf, chasing away other butterflies. Fond of flowers.

It can be distinguished by the [i]shiny, pearlescent white[/i] upperside and [i]thin, dark lines[/i] along hind wing underside wing veins.
 
There is considerable seasonal and geographical variation. Males are fairly constant in
upperside colour and markings, but on the underside the forewing apex and hind wing
ground colour can vary from pale cream to yellow, or grey-white. Females vary from
the nominate form [i]zochalia[/i], which resembles the male, to the yellow hind wing form
[i]hyoma[/i]. The rare form [i]agrippinides[/i] has a creamy yellow forewing and deep
yellow hind wing (not illustrated). In Gauteng and NW Province the dry season forms approach f. [i]immaculata[/i]; females never have yellow hind wings. The underside markings are [i]reduced or absent[/i] in these butterflies.
 
Flight fluttering, not usually sustained, along forest edges. Both sexes are often seen nectaring at flowers. In hot weather they may drink from mud puddles.

Medium-sized butterfly. It has two seasonal forms, which are different in appearance. Wet season (summer) form is deep orange with black bands and rows of spots, similar in appearance to Gaudy Commodore [i]Precis octavia sesamus[/i] but smaller, of a [i] less pink[/i] hue, and with [i]more extensive[/i] dark markings on both wing surfaces. Dry season (winter) form has a [i]leaf[/i]-like wing shape. Upperside similar to summer form but darker; underside similar to Dry-leaf Commodore [i]P. tugela tugela[/i] or Soldier Pansy [i]Junonia terea elgiva[/i], but uppersides very different and not found in same habitat. Could be confused on the wing with Pirate [i]Catacroptera cloanthe[/i] or one of the Jokers, [i]Byblia[/i] spp. It lacks the [i]plain underside[/i] of the former and the [i]pale bands and spots[/i] of the latter, which are smaller butterflies.
 
Sexes similar within the forms; females slightly larger.
 
Flies at low height to a metre or two above the ground, in grassy Savanna and woodland. Short glides interspersed with bursts of rapid wingbeats. Flies away rapidly if disturbed; males strongly territorial, sitting on prominent point, chasing away intruders. and if chased away, usually returning to where first seen.
 
Wet season form f. [i]simia[/i] deep bright orange with dark wing bases, marginal bands and complete submarginal row of black spots. Underside similarly marked to upperside. Dry season form f. [i]antilope[/i] similar upperside markings to f. [i]simia[/i] but ground colour [i]duller, darker[/i]. Underside is a convincing dead leaf mimic, varying greatly in colour from red-brown to black and greenish buff.

[i]More dainty[/i] than other [i]Trimenia[/i] species. The wings are less [i]acutely pointed[/i], especially in the male; there is less difference between the sexes. The typical [i]Trimenia[/i] upperside pattern of more or less bright fulvous-orange on the upperside with dark borders, and black-and-white chequered cilia, is continued in this species. The undersides are slightly different, in that the hind wing silvery marks are [i]cursive[/i] as in Wallengren's Silver-spotted Copper, but form a more coherent pattern with a [i]large '3'- or 'W'-shaped postdiscal line[/i] and a central roughly triangular blotch. There are two underside colour morphs, brown-and-tan, and wine-red.
 
[i]T. malagrida paarlensis[/i]: has no dark veining and the ochreous orange on the upperside is paler and more extensive than the nominate subspecies. Sexes very similar, females generally larger, paler orange, heavier bodied.
 
4 subspp., geographically distinct, all rare. Found in small, discrete colonies; flight rapid but not sustained; males select a prominent perch on a low plant or rock and chase away intruders. Females are found more at random, often on flowers.

[i]Yellow-ochre[/i] underside of both sexes conspicuous at rest, when wings closed. Hind wing underside has [i]two series of dark spots[/i], and a dark spot in the cell. Cilia plain pale grey-brown. Similar to Water Watchman [i]Parnara monasi[/i] but upperside very different, and hind wing underside has [i]only one series of postdiscal dark marks[/i]. Underside identical to that of Common Hottentot Skipper [i]Gegenes hottentota[/i], as is the female upperside. The male lacks the conspicuous sex brand of Marsh Hottentot Skipper.
 
Sexually dimorphic. Male upperside [i]bright yellow[/i] with brown forewing tips and a [i]conspicuous triangular black discal sex brand[/i] on the forewing; hind wing yellow. Female upperside [i]dark brown[/i] with discal series of creamy buff spots on [i]both wings[/i]. Spots shifted distally from the rest of the series in areas M, and R5. Essentially identical to that of Common Hottentot Skipper.
 
Flight rapid and erratic; low down, no more than 1m above the ground, settling often on grass, and low vegetation. Found in marshy wet areas. Males form territories along grassy stream and pond edges; females are found more at random.

Sexes similar; females usually larger and paler than males, with [i]more elongated wings[/i].
 
Males show strong territorial behaviour; they choose a prominent twig or leaf, usually on a hilltop shrub or tree. On this they perch and on occasion fly rapidly around their territory, with buzzing wings a blur. Other butterflies are attacked with vigour. Females are more sedentary and are usually found near the host plants. Both sexes perch wings-open.
 
There are two seasonal forms. wet season nominate form [i]venosa[/i], and dry season form [i]umvulensis[/i]. Nominate form [i]venosa[/i]: (A) Female upperside. (B) Female underside. Form [i]umvulensis[/i] is paler and has finer black lines: (C) Male upperside.

Distinctive medium-sized grey butterfly with tiny white spots edged with black. Its colouring resembles the Guinea Fowl, hence its common name. Well-worn specimens may appear dull and unattractive, but freshly emerged butterflies are striking. The only species that could be confused with it (habits are similar) is Mottled-green Nymph, [i]Euryphura achlys[/i], but that butterfly is much rarer and has a [i]metallic green[/i] upperside with a pattern of [i]regular, black[/i] blotches. Some seasonal variation. Wet season form f. [i]meleagris[/i] has prominent pattern of underside white spots mirroring upperside black spots.
 
Sexes similar, female larger, with wings more rounded.
 
Low, fast, gliding flight a few centimetres above the ground, wings open with occasional rapid wingbeats. Usually seen on bushveld paths and bare ground. Flies off rapidly to avoid pursuit. They settle readily, wings-open but are very wary and difficult to approach. Attracted to fallen fruit and animal faeces, and wet mud. They come to fruit baited traps.

Also resembles (and used to be confused with) Trimen's Blue [i]L. trimeni[/i]; that species' upperside is deeper, [i]duller blue[/i] and the underside ground colour [i]much darker, almost black[/i], with [i]dark spots thinly ringed with white[/i]. Both surfaces of both sexes' hind wings have a [i]single prominent orange lunule[/i] above a large black spot at the anal angle in area CuA1. Hind wing carries a small tail at end of vein CuA2. Cilia plain whitish grey.
 
Sexually dimorphic; female upperside resembles female Patrician Blue in having blue discal and basal areas inside wide dark fuscous-grey margins, but blue is [i]brighter, deeper[/i]. Male upperside is [i]iridescent azure[/i] with a fine black marginal line.
 
Males - often a dozen or more - ascend hills at midday but seldom to summits, circling prominent trees or rocks, or flying along contours. Also found in flat country near prominent trees and shrubs. Flight rapid, jinking and erratic. They settle occasionally on low vegetation where they can be approached with stealth. Female flight more random; usually found on flowers.

One of the larger sapphires; upperside [i]intense metallic blue[/i] with black margins and [i]shiny white[/i] underside. Underside hind wing crossed by submarginal [i]thin jagged black line[/i], not red as in Southern Sapphire [i]Iolaus silas[/i] or Straight-line Sapphire [i]I. silarus silarus[/i]. Upperside black margins narrower than in [i]I. silas[/i], particularly on the hind wing; similar in this respect to [i]I. silarus silarus[/i]. Forewing tips [i]more pointed[/i] (in both sexes) than either [i]I. silas[/i] or [i]I. silarus silarus[/i]. In males, the upperside red hind wing anal lunules that are conspicuous in [i]I. silas[/i] are [i]reduced or absent[/i].
 
Sexes differ slightly; female duller blue than male, hind wing upperside marginal band narrow; red only at anal angle, black-edged blue as far as M1, compared to very broad and red to M1 in [i]I. silas[/i]. Distal part of forewing upperside blue patch [i]suffused with white[/i] to lesser degree than in [i]I. silas[/i], sometimes absent. Male has conspicuous [i]sex brand[/i] at hind wing upperside costa.
 
Males perch atop hilltop shrubs and trees during midday hours, preferring those with glossy leaves against which their white underside is not easy to spot. But the white and blue combination is conspicuous in flight. Females are found closer to host plant, and nectaring at low flowers.

[i]C. celimene amina[/i] female has [i]no purple in upperside forewing tip[/i]. Both sexes have [i]pointed[/i] forewing tips. Sexually dimorphic. Female different to male, depending on the subspecies.
 
2 subspp., geographically distinct. Nominate male has distinct sexual behaviour: hovers
in circles, 2–4m up, close to a prominent tree, seldom settling, only moving away to
mate or chase off other males. At other times flies across the veld as do other Tips,
including the western subspecies [i]C. c. pholoe[/i]. Both sexes of both subspecies are found on flowers.

Identification
Tiny dark Skipper with black-and-white chequered upperside and forewing underside. One of a group of very similar little butterflies, which are difficult to tell apart from the upperside markings. To be reasonably sure of identification a clear view of the hind wing underside is necessary. Hind wing underside has pearly white median band made up of joined spots. That in the cell and submarginal spot in area M2 are [i]joined by a dark edged thin silvery line[/i]. In this respect resembles Star Sandman [i]S. asterodia[/i] and Grassveld Sandman [i]S. agylla[/i] but those are larger and the hind wing marks are plain white, not pearly. Cilia chequered.
 
Sexes similar; females usually larger than males, with [i]larger abdomen[/i].
 
Fast, buzzing, low flight, settling often, wings open. Male hilltops, but usually not at main summit. Also in flat country. Favours patches of stony ground among low vegetation. Male circles these areas with low, rapid flight, fast wingbeats. Female sometimes near the males, more usually looking for host plants. Both sexes feed on flowers.

Medium-sized butterfly. Battling Glider is the smaller of South Africa's two [i]Cymothoe[/i] species; the other being Blonde Glider [i]Cymothoecoranus coranus[/i]. Compared to that species, apart from size, [i]C. alcimeda[/i] has [i]more angulate[/i] wings and, usually, a more [i]heavily marked[/i] underside.
 
[i]C. a. marieps[/i] male has a distinct, dark trilobed mark in the middle of the forewing upperside cell. Two female forms named. Sexually dimorphic: male upperside creamy white; both sexes' underside cryptic.
 
Both sexes have the typical Limenitidinae gliding flight with bursts of rapid wingbeats. Males perch high up on forest edge trees and shrubs, and sally forth to chase away all other insects. When there is more than one male in a forest clearing, constant aerial battles take place, hence the common name. Females are found close to the host plants. Both sexes regularly drink at wet mud, and nectar from flowers. They are also attracted to fruit bait.

But that butterfly [i]lacks[/i] the broad dark margins and has a [i]single forewing discal spot[/i], not a band.
 
Sexes similar. Females larger than males.
 
Weak, fluttering flight. Flies slowly in the shade of trees in the forest understorey, settling on exposed twigs and the ends of tendrils, slowly opening and closing its wings. Often found flying with Zulu Buff [i]Teriomima zuluana[/i] and Spotted Buff [i]Pentila tropicalis[/i]. When handled, exudes bitter smelling fluid from the thorax, so it is probably a distasteful model, but it is not certain which species of lepidoptera mimic it.

Medium-sized butterfly. Battling Glider is the smaller of South Africa's two [i]Cymothoe[/i] species; the other being Blonde Glider [i]Cymothoecoranus coranus[/i]. Compared to that species, apart from size, [i]C. alcimeda[/i] has [i]more angulate[/i] wings and, usually, a more [i]heavily marked[/i] underside. [i]C. a. transvaalica[/i] male has a series of discrete dark postmedial angular marks on the upperside of both wings. Two female forms named. Male upperside creamy white; both sexes' underside cryptic.
 
Both sexes have the typical Limenitidinae gliding flight with bursts of rapid wingbeats. Males perch high up on forest edge trees and shrubs, and sally forth to chase away all other insects. When there is more than one male in a forest clearing, constant aerial battles take place, hence the common name. Females are found close to the host plants. Both sexes regularly drink at wet mud, and nectar from flowers. They are also attracted to fruit bait.

Identification
Small bright orange Bitter Acraea. The male is quite distinctive compared to other small butterflies in this genus. In wetlands the male may be mistaken for Marsh Acraea [i]T. rahira rahira[/i], but the solid black marginal border with ground colour spots is diagnostic. Some of the female forms with white forewing patches may be mistaken in flight for other Bitter Acraeas with such markings, but the hind wing underside marginal series of black-edged lunules is also diagnostic.
 
Sexes dimorphic. Male consistently orange, with characteristic spotted black margins, and black blotch at end of forewing cell on upperside. Females are very variable (a range is illustrated), from being similar to the male, to greater or lesser suffusion of black, white, buff and brown, to transparent.

Identification
Very small butterfly with patterns of orange or orange-red and black on the upperside; 
 has a greater or lesser amount of black in the centre of the forewing depending on sex and
subspecies. Underside irrorated with black, grey and white with tiny submarginal spots on
the hind wing. The other Rocksitters that fly in the same areas are Boland Rocksitter
[i]Durbaniopsis saga[/i] and two of the races of Amakosa Rocksitter, [i]Durbania amakosa
amakosa[/i] and [i]D. a. penningtoni[/i]. [i]Durbaniella clarki[/i] is generally smaller
than either, although small males of [i]D. saga[/i] can be in the same size range. It can
immediately be distinguished from that species by the underside; [i]D. clarki[/i] lacks
the [i]conspicuous dark and light bands[/i] of [i]D. saga[/i]. Compared to [i]D.
amakosa[/i], the differences are sex-related. Females of [i]D. amakosa[/i] are always much
larger and have more extensive, better defined patterns of orange or orange-red and black
on the upperside. [i]D. a. amakosa[/i] males have [i]discrete[/i] orange-red spots on the
upperside. [i]D. a. penningtoni[/i] males have very similar upperside markings to [i]D.
clarki[/i] but they are more of a [i]yellow-buff[/i] colour and the hind wing base is
[i]dark[/i].
 
Variable degree of sexual dimorphism depending on subspecies. Nominate subspecies [i]D. c. clarki[/i] upperside colouration varies from light orange to brick red; discal black patch well developed in both sexes but female has a broader postdiscal orange band than the male.
 
4 subspp., geographically distinct; varying in markings and colour.
 
Rocksitters, as their name suggests, like to sit on rocks; they do this for long periods with wings closed, their cryptic undersides hiding them well against lichen growing on the rock. Occasionally one will take off and patrol the area searching for mates. The flight is weak and fluttering, and they have trouble with headwinds, so they keep low, in the boundary layer. They lack a proboscis and cannot feed as adults, so they are never seen on flowers.

Back to Top
Identification
Medium-sized butterfly. It has two seasonal forms, which are very different in appearance and habits. Dry season (winter) form has blue upperside and green-black underside. Wet season (summer) form is orange-pink with black bands and rows of spots. Winter form is unique; summer form could be confused on the wing with Pirate [i]Catacroptera cloanthe[/i] or one of the Jokers, [i]Byblia[/i] spp. It lacks the [i]plain underside[/i] of the former and the [i]pale bands and spots[/i] of the latter, which are smaller butterflies.
 
Sexes similar within the forms; females slightly larger.
 
Flies at low height to a metre or two above the ground. Short glides interspersed with bursts of rapid wingbeats. Flies away rapidly if disturbed; males strongly territorial, sitting on prominent point, chasing away intruders. and if chased away, usually returning to where first seen. Summer form is a very active butterfly, usually found on open hillsides and summits. Winter form is more skulking, found more often gardens and woods near montane Grassland, or along stream banks. It hibernates in deep gullies and under banks and rocks; roosts gregariously. Several dozen may be disturbed from such secluded shelters. Both forms are often found nectaring on flowers.
 
Wet season form f. [i]natalensis[/i] bright orange-red with dark wing bases, marginal bands and complete submarginal row of black spots. Dry season form f. [i]sesamus[/i] deep blue with bands of black and paler blue spots; a submarginal row of red spots, and white submarginal spots at the forewing apex. Occasional intermediates occur, which vary greatly in colour, from red and blue, to purple, with varying extent of dark markings.

Large black butterfly with white or blue spots and bands. Unique among South African Charaxes in having [i]rounded wings[/i] and [i]no tails[/i]. Was until recently placed in the genus [i]Euxanthe[/i], but DNA studies showed no reason for maintaining this as a separate taxon. Distinctive pied patterning. [i]Bright yellow[/i] abdomen often visible in flight.
 
Sexually dimorphic. Male has pale narrow forewing band and hind wing basal patch with small hind wing submarginal spots. These have a blue sheen that appears white when viewed at an acute angle. Female has [i]much broader[/i] white forewing band, and [i]better developed[/i] hind wing submarginal spots.
 
Strong, soaring flight. Males gather around tree tops and small hills, where three or four may chase each other around. Female seen flying around forest edges, and around the host plant.

Identification
Tiny to small butterfly. Males have brown-black upperside, female [i]distinctly pied in
 dark grey and white[/i]. Undersides are cryptic with patches of beautiful metallic
scales. Male very similar to that of Common Woolly Legs [i]Lachnocnema bibulus[/i] from
which it can only be separated by genitalic dissection. Male has some similarities to D'Urban's Woolly Legs [i]L. durbani[/i] but that butterfly is a denizen of Grassland, the upperside is a [i]dull grey-brown[/i] and the underside has a [i]regular[/i] pattern of buff or pale brown on a grey ground.
 
Sexually dimorphic. Male upperside brown-black, female [i]dark grey[/i] with [i]well-defined[/i] white discal patches, and [i]basal pale grey suffusion[/i]. Large dark patch at distal end of forewing cell. Male underside hind wing median band [i]always dark brown[/i], median band wider than in Common Woolly Legs; [i]lacks copper sheen[/i] but only reliably separated by genitalic dissection.
 
These butterflies are always found close to concentrations of aphids, plant Hoppers or scale insects (Homoptera), on which the larvae prey. There are also always ants present, because the larvae shelter during the day in ants' nests. Males are territorial and sit atop bushes or on prominent plants, sallying forth to confront intruders. They fly fast, rapidly circling trees and shrubs harbouring larval prey. Female are sedentary and seldom leave the twigs where the scale insects are feeding.

Identification
Small, brilliant scarlet-red lycaenid. Male Dark-banded Scarlet similar to Common Scarlet [i]Axiocerses tjoane tjoane[/i] but has [i]line of dark submarginal spots[/i] on hind wing upperside. Compared to Black-tipped Scarlet [i]A. coalescens[/i] the absence on the male upperside forewing of discal black spots sets that species apart. Bush Scarlet [i]A. amanga amanga[/i] has a [i]plain hind wing underside[/i] with [i]no brassy spots[/i]. The wing edges are [i]more sharply angled[/i] than other Scarlets, in both sexes.
 
The underside is deep reddish brown, tending to blackish, with [i]enlarged brassy spots[/i]. The forewing has a similar spotting pattern to most Coppers; the hind wing has rows of dark spots with brassy centres.
 
Sexes differ; females are [i]more orange than red[/i] on the upperside with a varying extent of rows of dark spotting. They are very difficult to distinguish from the other two similar species, but the angled wing edges may assist.
 
Males are extremely pugnacious hilltoppers. Rapid flight with very fast wingbeats, especially in males. Male perches at midday on low bushes, often upside down, with half-open wings. Females are more often found on flowers and close to host plants.

Hind wing underside sometimes with [i]large ocelli[/i] in apical and anal areas, underside forewing basal rust-red patch reaches as far as apical ocellus; hind wing underside grey-brown ground colour irrorated with tiny short dark red-brown striae grouped into ill-defined bands.
 
[i]S. w. grisea[/i] is the smallest subspecies, with a more [i]angular[/i] wing shape. Upperside ground colour is a [i]paler[/i] greyish-brown. The red patches are smaller and the irregular ocelli broadly ringed with pale greyish-ochre. The hind wing underside is also paler with distinct bands of dark striae. The antennae are pale reddish-brown unlike the dark antennae of the other subspecies. Sexes similar, female heavier, with stouter abdomen, and wings more elongated. Female has more sedentary habits.
 
Slow, jinking flight, settling often on rocks, jerkily opening and closing wings. Visits flowers, where it tends to be less wary.

Small butterfly, with [i]bright, deep buff[/i] upperside and [i]more rounded[/i] wings than the Brauns's Skolly group. Wings rounder, forewing upperside markings [i]less angulate, more exaggerated[/i] contrast between light and dark than Mountain Skolly [i]Thestor montanus[/i]; [i]not as bright[/i] as [i]T. pictus[/i]. [i]Less variable[/i] than [i]T. montanus[/i] or Van Son's Skolly [i]T. vansoni[/i], but the extent and shade of buff does vary somewhat between specimens. Underside hind wing of both sexes has [i]dark, contrasting[/i] basal and discal bands of marks; submarginal row of 'V'-shaped marks forming a [i]strongly sagittate[/i] line.
 
Sexually dimorphic. Females [i]paler[/i] than males, distal edges of buff patch [i]noticeably sagittate[/i] along veins. Male upperside shows [i]prominent dark scaling[/i] along veins. Forewing has an indistinct grey-brown sex brand at the basal juncture of veins M3 and CuA1.
 
[i]T. rooibergensis[/i] lives in colonies, usually on mountain slopes covered with scattered large rocks. The females fly more slowly than the males. Flight is low, fast and sustained, dodging between rocks and plants. They settle often on low vegetation or rocks, but are wary and difficult to approach. Usually found in groups of three or four, but in the right conditions can occur in large numbers.

Medium-sized butterfly. Battling Glider is the smaller of South Africa's two [i]Cymothoe[/i] species; the other being Blonde Glider [i]Cymothoecoranus coranus[/i]. Compared to that species, apart from size, [i]C. alcimeda[/i] has [i]more angulate[/i] wings and, usually, a more [i]heavily marked[/i] underside. [i]C. a. trimeni[/i] males are very similar to those of [i]C. a. clarki[/i], but the named female forms are different. Sexually dimorphic: male upperside creamy white; both sexes' underside cryptic.
 
Both sexes have the typical Limenitidinae gliding flight with bursts of rapid wingbeats. Males perch high up on forest edge trees and shrubs, and sally forth to chase away all other insects. When there is more than one male in a forest clearing, constant aerial battles take place, hence the common name. Females are found close to the host plants. Both sexes regularly drink at wet mud, and nectar from flowers. They are also attracted to fruit bait.

Tiny dark Skipper with black-and-white chequered upperside and forewing underside. One of a group of very similar little butterflies, which are difficult to tell apart from the upperside markings. To be reasonably sure of identification a clear view of the hind wing underside is necessary. Only South African [i]Spialia[/i] besides Bushveld Sandman to have hind wing upperside submarginal spots in M1 and M2 out of line, shifted basally. Forewing apex [i]short and blunt[/i], hind wing underside median band [i]straight, contiguous[/i]. Tapers from costa to inner margin as in Delagoa [i]S. delagoae[/i], Boland [i]S. sataspes[/i] and Wandering [i]S. depauperata australis[/i] Sandmen, but edges [i]jagged[/i] as in Forest Sandman [i]S. dromus[/i].

Medium–small dark Skipper. Upperside blackish brown with greenish yellow hairs and pale spots. Upperside ground colour brown. Has [i]three tiny hyaline subapical spots[/i], and small hyaline spots in areas M2 and M3. Usually, but not always, has [i]two small hyaline spots in forewing cell[/i]. Sexes differ in markings in CuA1 and CuA2. Underside medium brown, suffused with white; [i]seven small white discal spots[/i] on hind wing in areas 3A to Sc+R1. Cilia plain pale grey-brown. Similar to some of the [i]Borbo[/i] Swifts that have yellow or green hairs on the upperside. Rusty Swift [i]Borbo detecta[/i] has distinctly [i]reddish yellow ochre[/i] hairs. Olive-haired Swift [i]B. borbonica[/i] has olive-green hairs but the hind wing underside black-ringed white spots are distinctive. Twin Swift [i]Larsenia gemella[/i] has yellowish to greenish ochre hairs, but has [i]only three[/i] hind wing underside discal spots.
 
Sexually dimorphic. Male has [i]black[/i] forewing discal sex brand diagonally crossing CuA1 and CuA2. Female [i]lacks sex brand[/i]; larger than male, wings more elongated, forewing upperside has [i]hyaline discal spot[/i] in CuA2, [i]white spot[/i] in CuA1. Apart from the different colour of the male sex brand, the number of discal hind wing underside spots distinguishes this species from the very similar White-branded Swift [i]Pelopidas thrax[/i].
 
Males are territorial on hilltops, at edges of forest, along roads, paths or streams, chasing intruding males. Flight rapid, but settling often on low shrubs, grass stems or rocks; fairly easy to approach. Females are more sedentary, around flowers.

Black spots on both surfaces but black-centred red ocelli on [i]upperside[/i] only. [i]Smaller[/i] than Common Mother-of-pearl [i]P. parhassus[/i], which has forewing tips [i]less heavily marked with black[/i]. Lacks the greenish gloss of [i]P. parhassus[/i].
 
Sexes similar in all forms but females are [i]more heavily marked[/i] in black, with broader dark margins, sometimes with a golden sheen as in wet season form female f. [i]lurida[/i].
 
Males perch at medium height on forest edges, and sally forth to pursue other males. Both sexes roost among the foliage of large-leafed plants in the dry season. Often flies with similar Common Mother-of-pearl. Follows wooded river valleys into dry Savanna, where it feeds on flowers.

Large, dark Charaxes. In certain parts of its range, males can be confused with Blue-Spotted Charaxes, [i]Charaxes cithaeron cithaeron[/i]. However, that species has [i]much broader[/i] hind wing upperside pale patch, almost totally white. The postdiscal series of forewing royal blue marks are [i]smaller[/i] in [i]C. xiphares[/i]. Females are distinctive. [i]C. x. bavenda[/i] male, with [i]C. x. staudei[/i] is distinguished by the suffusion of white into the hind wing upperside discal patch, and broad marginal lunules. The female has the spots near the inner forewing upperside [i]enlarged[/i]. There are three female forms. Nominate upperside has white forewing discal spots and yellow hind wing discal patch. In f. [i]ochreomacula[/i] the forewing discal spots are tinged with yellow-ochre, and in [i]cyanescens[/i] the forewing spots are white but the hind wing patch is white suffused with lavender.
 
Sexes strongly dimorphic, male with [i]royal blue[/i] spots and bands on metallic navy ground, female with [i]white discal forewing band[/i] (of variable width) sometimes invaded by yellow-ochre. Most females have a pale yellow hind wing upperside patch, but in some populations, it is blue-white or pale mauve. Differences between females is usually of more value than subtle differences between the males in distinguishing subspecies.
 
Powerful, high flight in the canopy and around tree tops. Males territorial, perching high up and pursuing any butterfly (or other flying creature) that ventures nearby. Females fly rapidly along the fringes of forests where they settle on tree leaves.
 
Both sexes are attracted to rotting fruit, animal dung and sap leaking from wounded trees.

Identification
One of a large group of [i]Chrysoritis[/i] Opals with [i]blue wing bases[/i] and a [i]shimmering, electric opalescent sheen[/i] over a varying area of the wings. For [i]Chrysoritis thysbe[/i], amount of blue on upperside varies, in some subspecies almost covering the forewing. Forewing underside has typical 'Copper' pattern of black spots on a pale ground with dark borders. Hind wing underside varies from plain sandy tan to dark brown, to [i]variegated[/i] with striae in various shades of reddish-brown, with bands of paler colouring and brassy postdiscal streaks. 'Plain' underside specimens usually have unicoloured cilia; 'variegated' ones dark cilia with pale interneural flecks, appearing 'chequered'.
 
[i]C. t. bamptoni[/i] underside may be the plain or variegated form, but the dark striae are always visible. The upperside blue in the male extends beyond the forewing cell to the apex and may cover most of the wing. Margins always dark, but the wing apex usually has some orange. Sexes differ. Female has [i]rounder wings[/i], upperside blue [i]restricted to basal 25% of wings[/i], no opalescent sheen. The females of the various races are almost impossible to separate on wing patterns and identification usually requires comparison with males seen at the same locality.
 
7 subspp., not always geographically distinct. Rapid, sustained flight, settling on prominent bushes or rocks. Male intensively territorial on hill tops or sand dunes, regularly patrolling and chasing intruders; Females are found more at random, often on flowers.
 
(I) Male upperside. (J) Male underside, variegated form. (K) Female upperside. (L) Female underside, plain form.

Identification
Small black-and-orange/red butterflies; uppersides are black with varying degrees of red/orange spots and blotches. Undersides are beautifully camouflaged against their habitat; intricate patterns of black or dark grey on a white or pale grey ground, with submarginal spots in varying shades of red to orange, yellow or white. There are some similar species to Amakosa Rocksitter; Natal Rocksitter [i]Durbania limbata[/i] upperside has outer half of hind wing [i]broad[/i] red; sexes similar and flies in late summer to autumn, not spring and early summer. And Clark's Rocksitter [i]D. clarki[/i] is much smaller and its range does not overlap with that of [i]D. amakosa[/i].
 
Sexually dimorphic. [i]D. a. natalensis[/i] has the deepest red upperside markings on both wings and in both sexes; the females have very broad orange-red patches. The submarginal hind wing underside dots are red.
 
7 subspp., geographically distinct.
 
Rocksitters, as their name suggests, like to sit on rocks; they do this for long periods with wings closed, their cryptic undersides hiding them well against lichen growing on the rock. Occasionally one will take off and patrol the area searching for mates. The flight is weak and fluttering, and they have trouble with headwinds, so they keep low, in the boundary layer. They lack a proboscis and cannot feed as adults, so they are never seen on flowers.

Identification
Very large, conspicuous black and yellow butterfly with well-developed spatulate tails. Largest South African butterfly.

Constantine's Swallowtail [i]P. constantinus[/i] and Bush Kite [i]P. euphranor[/i] are both superficially similar but [i]lack large blue hind wing postdiscal lunules on both wing surfaces[/i]. The forewing discal band of spots varies in shape and width between the subspecies.
 
The nominate subspecies is not found in South Africa. [i]P. ophidicephalus zuluensis[/i], like [i]P. o. phalusco[/i], is also very large; this species is found very close to the populations of [i]P. o. phalusco[/i] that are largest in size, in the Tugela Valley. It may be that size is determined by environmental conditions and not genetics. The forewing discal band of yellow spots is [i]nearly straight[/i] but [i]narrower than in P. o. phalusco and does not widen as much towards the apex[/i]. In males the spots in areas R3 to M1 are usually [i]joined[/i]; in females the spots may be joined as far down the wing as CuA1. Sexes similar; male has [i]bands of shiny scent scales[/i] on forewing between postdiscal and submarginal yellow spots. Females have varying degrees of irroration with yellow scales in these areas.
 
5 subspp., geographically distinct. Flies fast with powerful wingbeats; may stoop low
to investigate flowers. Follows gullies and roads in thick forest. Males are often seen

Identification
This little species is unique among butterflies in SA because of its regular pattern of black dots on a yellow-buff ground. However not unmistakable because it closely resembles a diurnal moth, Leopard Magpie, [i]Zerenopsis lepida[/i] (Geometridae; Ennominae). This moth's larvae feed on a Grassland cycad, [i]Stangeria eriopus[/i], which occurs in the butterfly's habitat.
 
Sexes similar.
 
Low, fluttering flight among grass stems. Favours moist grassy areas; often found at forest edges.
 
(A) Male upperside. (B) Male underside.
Mimic
(Possibly) Muellerian mimic of Leopard Magpie, [i]Zerenopsis lepida[/i] (Geometridae; Ennominae). Also closely resembles the lycaenid Spotted Buff, [i]Pentila tropicalis[/i], but this is a true forest species so they are unlikely to interact.

Identification
Small bright yellow Pierid. Differs from African Clouded Yellow [i]Colias electo electo[/i] in upperside ground colour [i]yellow, not orange[/i], and Spiller's Sulphur Yellow [i]Dixeia spilleri[/i], in that it has [i]broad black borders[/i]. Black forewing upperside marginal band [i]scalloped[/i], which sets it apart from other [i]Eurema[/i] species except Malagasy Grass Yellow [i]E. floricola[/i]. This is a very similar species but Common Grass Yellow can be told from it as follows: underside hind wing cell spot seldom widens towards the apical end, to not more than twice the width of the narrow portion. The hind wing margin is [i]continuously black[/i], or if it is reduced as in dry season individuals, the [i]marks at the end of the veins are linear smudges, not spots[/i]. Best identifying feature is where the scalloped edge of forewing upperside black border bends inwards along vein M3, not halfway up area M2 as in Malagasy Grass Yellow (see arrow in (A)).
 
Sexes similar, female [i]paler yellow[/i] than male, has grey scaling at upperside wing bases.
 
Fluttering flight, fairly low, along thick forest vegetation, or in open Savanna country. Settles often on flowers or vegetation. Can fly fast if disturbed.
 
Seasonally dimorphic. Dry season form has dark smudges at the hind wing upperside margin vein ends; underside forewing tip carries a [i]square dark patch[/i]: (A) Male upperside. (B) Male underside.
 
Wet season form has a [i]continuous dark hind wing upperside marginal band[/i] and the underside forewing tip is [i]plain yellow[/i]. (C) Male underside.

Identification
Medium–large white or yellow Pierid. Superficially resembles Brown-veined White [i]Belenois aurota[/i], at least in the male and the white form female. The male has a [i]falcate forewing tip[/i]; both sexes' underside hind wings have [i]a postdiscal row of sagittate dark marks[/i]. Unlike Brown-veined White, there is a yellow female form, and strong seasonal dimorphism. May also be confused with Forest White [i]B. zochalia[/i] but is [i]larger[/i] and [i]lacks the upperside pearlescent sheen[/i].
 
Sexually dimorphic. Male forewing tip is [i]pointed, falcate[/i]. Female has [i]square[/i] forewing tips. Male dark markings are confined to the tips and margins; females have extensive basal dark patches (in wet season forms) and [i]postdiscal spots[/i].
 
Wet season male form [i]doubledayi[/i] has [i]extensive black marginal forewing marks[/i]; underside hind wing ground colour [i]white with thin black veins and interneural black postdiscal sagittate marks[/i]. Female form [i]doubledayi is buff-yellow[/i] on both wing surfaces; [i]heavy black hind wing upperside marginal bands[/i]; upperside basal areas [i]strongly marked with dark scaling[/i].

Identification
Tiny to small butterfly. Males have brown-black upperside, female [i]grey to grey-brown[/i]. Undersides are cryptic with patches of beautiful metallic scales. Male very similar to that of Southern Pied Woolly Legs [i]Lachnocnema laches[/i]. Male has some similarities to D'Urban's Woolly Legs [i]L. durbani[/i] but that butterfly's male has a [i]dull grey[/i]-brown upperside and is a denizen of Grassland. Its underside has a [i]regular[/i] pattern of buff or pale brown on a grey ground.
 
Sexually dimorphic. Male upperside brown-black, female [i]soft grey to grey-brown[/i] with [i]ill-defined[/i] blue-grey discal patches, and postdiscal white streaks. Dark spot at distal end of forewing cell. Male underside hind wing has more or less distinct median band of variable width.
 
These butterflies are always found close to concentrations of aphids, plant Hoppers or scale insects (Homoptera), on which the larvae prey. There are also always ants present, because the larvae shelter during the day in ants' nests. Males are territorial and sit atop bushes or on prominent plants, sallying forth to confront intruders. They fly fast, rapidly circling trees and shrubs harbouring larval prey. Female are sedentary and seldom leave the twigs where the scale insects are feeding.

The underside ground colour varies from pale sandy buff to a deep reddish brown. The forewing has a similar spotting pattern to most Coppers; the hind wing has rows of dark spots with brassy centres.
 
Sexes differ; females are [i]more orange than red[/i] on the upperside with a varying extent of rows of dark spotting: they are virtually impossible to distinguish from the other two similar species.
 
Males are extremely pugnacious hilltoppers. Rapid flight with very fast wingbeats, especially in males. Male perches at midday on low bushes, often upside down, with half-open wings. Females are more often found on flowers and close to host plants.

Tiny lycaenid; when examined close up the only species that can be confused with it is Purple Gem, [i]Chloroselas mazoensis[/i]. Apart from the differences in the male uppersides, the undersides of both sexes can be told apart by the [i]deep buff[/i] colour of Brilliant Gem, carrying [i]larger, better defined[/i] brassy centred spots. Each hind wing carries a pair of thin tails with white tips at the anal angle.
 
Sexually dimorphic. The male upperside has a shifting, metallic [i]brilliant electric iridescence[/i] that shifts from [i]blue to green[/i], over a blackish brown ground colour. This is very beautiful, but only visible when viewed under light coming from the correct acute angle. Female is [i]dull-brown[/i] above, sometimes with buff patch in middle of forewing on upperside, and sparse blue scaling, but [i]no electric sheen[/i].
 
Habits similar to Bars, High-fliers and Scarlets but small size and rapid flight makes them difficult to spot amongst the hordes of tiny Babul Blues ([i]Azanus[/i] sp.) and Hairtails ([i]Anthene[/i] sp.) with which they habitually fly. Occasionally in strong colonies, but more often in groups of 6–8.

Back to Top
Identification
Small to medium-sized orange butterfly with black bands. One of two species of Joker found in South Africa. Conspicuous, bright orange, small butterfly. Can be told apart from Spotted Joker [i]Byblia ilithyia[/i] by [i]lack of black spotting[/i] in hind wing upperside discal band. Underside shows considerable seasonal variation; Nominate dry season form hind wing underside crossed with chocolate-brown bands and yellow-white spots. More common wet season form f. [i]similata[/i] has [i]yellow-ochre[/i] hind wing on underside, basal spots black, submarginal band black with small white spots. Other superficially similar species are Gaudy Commodore [i]Precis octavia sesamus[/i] f. [i]natalensis[/i], and Pirate [i]Catacroptera cloanthe[/i]. The former lacks the [i]pale underside markings[/i] and the latter has a [i]plain[/i] underside.
 
Sexes similar in markings: male [i]much brighter orange[/i] than female, edges of black marks [i]better defined[/i].
 
Active, erratic flight, usually not more than 1–2m above the ground, in open grassy areas and between bushes. Frequently settles on plants but seldom flowers, wings open, slowly 'pumping' them. Like [i]B. ilithyia[/i] and [i]Danaus chrysippus[/i], commonly seen sucking grass flowerheads, behaviour that is not currently understood as grasses do not produce nectar. Both sexes are attracted to fallen fruit and come readily to traps baited with this.

Identification
Small brown butterfly with black upperside markings. Large for a [i]Thestor[/i]; unique and unmistakable; does not fit into any of the Skolly groups. [i]Brown[/i], as opposed to buff or grey; build [i]more robust[/i] than other Skollies and female has distinctive white forewing upperside black and white markings. Underside is pale grey-buff with discal area of forewing whitish, with black basal and postdiscal spots. Hind wing basal and postdiscal series are a darker buff-grey.
 
Sexually dimorphic. Males have acutely [i]pointed[/i] forewing and [i]straight[/i] outer margin. Females have blunt-ended forewings and [i]convex[/i] outer margin Extent of white on both wings of female is extremely variable. Some specimens are distinctly [i]pied[/i]; others have hardly any white and are all dun-brown with heavy black forewing blotches. Nominate subspecies [i]T. b. basuta[/i] males have pointed wing tips and the forewing discal area is usually pale grey-brown with darker brown or black marks. The female varies greatly as described, and very dark individuals can be found flying with pale pied examples that would answer to the description of [i]T. b. capeneri[/i].
 
2 subspp., geographically distinct.
 
Male flies fast, settling often on the ground or on stones. Females are sluggish and usually seen flying slowly, close to the ground, seeking out oviposition spots. Usually seen in small groups of a dozen or so, but occasionally much bigger numbers are seen, huge colonies covering large areas of Grassland.

Identification
Large, dark Charaxes. In certain parts of its range, males can be confused with Blue-Spotted Charaxes, [i]Charaxes cithaeron cithaeron[/i]. However, that species has [i]much broader[/i] hind wing upperside pale patch, almost totally white. The postdiscal series of forewing royal blue marks are [i]smaller[/i] in [i]C. xiphares[/i]. Females are distinctive. [i]C. x. kenwayi[/i] is a small race. The male has [i]enlarged[/i] blue marks on the upperside. There are two female forms. Nominate has a white hind wing upperside discal patch. f. [i]lutea[/i], which is the dominant form, has a yellow patch.
 
Sexes strongly dimorphic, male with [i]royal blue[/i] spots and bands on metallic navy ground, female with [i]white discal forewing band[/i] (of variable width) sometimes invaded by yellow-ochre. Most females have a pale yellow hind wing upperside patch, but in some populations, it is blue-white or pale mauve. Differences between females is usually of more value than subtle differences between the males in distinguishing subspecies.
 
Powerful, high flight in the canopy and around tree tops. Males territorial, perching high up and pursuing any butterfly (or other flying creature) that ventures nearby. Females fly rapidly along the fringes of forests where they settle on tree leaves.
 
Both sexes are attracted to rotting fruit, animal dung and sap leaking from wounded trees.
