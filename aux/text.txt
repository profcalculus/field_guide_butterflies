Back to Top  Identification  Large, conspicuous black and yellow butterfly with well-developed spatulate tails. Similar colouring to tailless Citrus Swallowtail Papilio demodocus and much larger Emperor Swallowtail, P. ophidicephalus , but there is never any red colouring on the hind wing anal angle as seen in those species. It is closest in appearance to the Bush Kite P. euphranor , but apart from the difference in habits (it never soars over the canopy as P. euphranor does), it always has a pale spot at the distal end of the forewing cell. The underside is paler than in P. euphranor , with dark 'rays' running between the veins on the postdiscal areas of both wings.  &nbsp;  Sexes similar; females usually larger and paler than males.  &nbsp;  Retiring habits, showing a preference for the shade of thick bush, wooded valleys and sand forests. Has the typical swallowtail fluttering, swooping flight, restless, seldom sitting still when nectaring. Like all Swallowtails it often sits on wet mud, drinking - especially males, where animals have urinated on the mud.  &nbsp;  (A) Male upper side. (B) Female upper side. (C) Female underside.

Back to Top  Identification  Medium to large butterfly, with weak but sustained fluttering flight, sometimes sailing, at medium height, 2-3m above the ground. Usually found flying alone or in small groups, but may be found in large numbers on wounded plants exuding pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Fond of nectar. This butterfly has complex biogeography; it is widespread across Asia, southern Europe and the whole of Africa. Several variants occur across this range, the relationship between these is the subject of several studies.  &nbsp;  A form resembling Danaus chrysippus dorippus , the common subspecies in the arid northern and eastern side of Africa, is the rarest in South Africa. The wing tip is orange, lacking the white-spotted black pattern. Typical D. c. dorippus has the orange spreading all the way from the wing bases; form klugii has chocolate-brown basal suffusion and form transiens is similar to klugii but in addition has traces of the white forewing spots seen in D. c. orientis and D. c. alcippus .  &nbsp;  Further north in Africa, all the forms of D. c. dorippus may be found with the white hind wing patch of D. c. alcippus , but these are not found in SA.  &nbsp;  It is possible that the appearance of forms resembling D. c. dorippus among the South African D. c. orientis population is a result of edge-of-range interbreeding with those races when climatic conditions make this possible.  &nbsp;  (E) Male upper side (f. dorippus ). (F) Female upper side (f. klugii ). (G) Female underside (close to f. transiens ). Undersides of (E) and (F) resemble that of (G).
